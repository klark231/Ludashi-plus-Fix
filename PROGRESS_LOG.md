# Ludashi-plus Progress Log

Build and modification history for Ludashi-plus — Winlator Ludashi v2.9 bionic with GOG, Epic Games, and Amazon Games store integration.

---

## Session: 2026-04-08 — Game Stores Integration

### Research & Reverse Engineering (Passes 1–38)
- Full reverse engineering of Winlator Ludashi v2.9 bionic APK documented in `LUDASHI_MASTER_MAP.md`
- Mapped all 38+ passes of analysis covering: Activities, Fragments, Container system, XServerDisplayActivity launch pipeline, SharedPreferences schema, DefaultVersion constants, FEXCore/Box64 preset tables, FrameRating update intervals, env var build order
- Confirmed 3 consecutive clean passes → convergence declared

### Game Stores Feature Design
- Decision: Port BannerHub GOG/Epic/Amazon store Activities to Ludashi-plus
- Source: `~/bannerhub/extension/*.java` (29 Java files)
- Launch bridge: `LudashiLaunchBridge` uses reflection to call `ContainerManager.getContainers()` and start `XServerDisplayActivity` — no compile-time dependency on Ludashi classes

### Files Changed

#### New: `extension/` (29 Java files)
All files adapted from BannerHub: package changed `app.revanced.extension.gamehub` → `com.winlator.cmod.store`

| File | Role |

| `AmazonLaunchHelper.java` | Ported as-is |
| `AmazonSdkManager.java` | Ported as-is |

#### Modified: `patches/res/menu/main_menu.xml`
- Added `group_game_stores` group (checkableBehavior=none) with 3 items:
  - `main_menu_gog` — "GOG"
  - `main_menu_epic` — "Epic Games"
  - `main_menu_amazon` — "Amazon Games"

#### Modified: `patches/res/values/public.xml`
- Added 4 new resource IDs:
  - `group_game_stores` = 0x7f090387
  - `main_menu_amazon` = 0x7f090388
  - `main_menu_epic` = 0x7f090389
  - `main_menu_gog` = 0x7f09038a

#### Modified: `patches/AndroidManifest.xml`
- Registered 9 new Activities:
  - `com.winlator.cmod.store.GogMainActivity`
  - `com.winlator.cmod.store.GogLoginActivity`
  - `com.winlator.cmod.store.GogGamesActivity`
  - `com.winlator.cmod.store.EpicMainActivity`
  - `com.winlator.cmod.store.EpicLoginActivity`
  - `com.winlator.cmod.store.EpicGamesActivity`
  - `com.winlator.cmod.store.AmazonMainActivity`
  - `com.winlator.cmod.store.AmazonLoginActivity`
  - `com.winlator.cmod.store.AmazonGamesActivity`

#### Modified: `patches/smali_classes8/com/winlator/cmod/MainActivity.smali`
- Added 3 `if-eq` branches before packed-switch in `onNavigationItemSelected()`:
  - `0x7f09038a` (GOG) → `startActivity(GogMainActivity)`
  - `0x7f090389` (Epic) → `startActivity(EpicMainActivity)`
  - `0x7f090388` (Amazon) → `startActivity(AmazonMainActivity)`

#### New: `.github/workflows/build.yml`
- Triggers on `v*` tags and `workflow_dispatch`
- Downloads Winlator-Ludashi v2.9 bionic APK from StevenMXZ/Winlator-Ludashi
- Decodes with apktool 2.9.3
- Applies patches/
- Compiles extension/*.java with android.jar + org.json → d8 → classes17.dex
- Injects classes17.dex into rebuilt APK
- Signs with AOSP testkey, uploads to GitHub release

### Build Process (Compilation Chain)
- `javac -source 8 -target 8 -cp android.jar:org-json.jar → ext_classes/`
- `d8 --release --min-api 26 → ext_dex/classes.dex`
- This is injected as `classes17.dex` into the APK zip after apktool build

### Launch Behavior (v1)
After game downloads in store Activity:
- `LudashiLaunchBridge.triggerLaunch(activity, exePath)` called
- Reflectively loads `ContainerManager`, gets first container
- Toast shows install path
- Starts `XServerDisplayActivity` with `container_id`
- Wine desktop opens — user navigates to exe manually

### Root Causes Fixed (CI debugging chain)
1. Wrong APK filename (`winlator-ludashi-bionic.apk` → `ludashi-bionic.apk`)
2. `ab_*.png` and `ab_gear_*.png` are raw animation frames, not valid PNGs — aapt1/aapt2 both reject them
3. `animated_background.xml` references the deleted pseudo-PNGs — must also be removed
4. `public.xml` in `patches/` retained entries for all deleted files → must remove them
5. New menu IDs (`group_game_stores`, `main_menu_gog/epic/amazon`) need explicit `<item type="id">` declaration in an ids.xml for aapt1
6. `GITHUB_TOKEN` needs `contents: write` permission for release creation in `workflow_dispatch`

### Signing
APK is signed with the AOSP public testkey (`testkey.pk8` / `testkey.x509.pem`, committed to repo). Fine for sideloading; not suitable for signature-verified updates. A private keystore stored as a GitHub Actions secret is the upgrade path if needed.

### Device Test Results (2026-04-08, v1.0.0-pre1)
- [x] Three store entries visible in nav drawer (GOG, Epic Games, Amazon Games) ✓
- [x] Store Activities open correctly from nav drawer ✓
- [x] GOG login/library/install pipeline works ✓
- [x] Download completes, game installed ✓
- [~] "Add to Launcher" booted Wine container directly (v1 behavior — no container picker, no shortcut written) → **fixed in v1.0.0-pre2**

---

## Session: 2026-04-08 — Container Picker + Shortcuts Integration (v1.0.0-pre2)

### Problem
"Add to Launcher" in v1 called `LudashiLaunchBridge.triggerLaunch()` which picked the first container and immediately booted `XServerDisplayActivity`. No shortcut was written, no container choice, user was dropped into a bare Wine desktop.

### Fix
Replaced launch behavior with shortcut creation:

1. **Container picker dialog** — `addToLauncher()` reflectively loads `ContainerManager.getContainers()`, builds a list of container names, shows `AlertDialog` for user to pick
2. **Shortcut file written** — after selection, `writeShortcut()` calls `Container.getDesktopDir()` via reflection, writes `{gameName}.desktop` to the container's Wine desktop directory
3. **Shortcut format** — standard Ludashi `.desktop` file:
   ```
   [Desktop Entry]
   Name={gameName}
   Exec={absLinuxExePath}
   Icon=
   Type=Application
   StartupWMClass=explorer

   [Extra Data]
   ```
4. **Success toast** — "Added to Shortcuts. Open side menu → Shortcuts to launch and configure it."

Shortcut appears in Ludashi's **Shortcuts** nav item. User can launch it and customize Wine setup (graphics driver, DX wrapper, emulator, etc.) via the native `ShortcutSettingsDialog`.

### Files Changed
- `extension/LudashiLaunchBridge.java` — replaced `triggerLaunch()` with `addToLauncher()` + `writeShortcut()`
- `extension/GogLaunchHelper.java` — `triggerLaunch()` → `addToLauncher(activity, name, path)`
- `extension/GogGamesActivity.java` — 4 call sites updated to pass `game.title`
- `extension/EpicGamesActivity.java` — `pendingLaunchExe(path)` → `pendingLaunchExe(name, path)`
- `extension/AmazonGamesActivity.java` — same as Epic

### Commits & Builds
| Commit | Tag | Description | CI Run | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `f2b737d` | v1.0.0-pre2 | feat: container picker + .desktop shortcut creation | [24157723585](https://github.com/The412Banner/Ludashi-plus/actions/runs/24157723585) | ✅ success |

### Device Test Results (2026-04-08, v1.0.0-pre2)
- [x] Container picker shows on "Add to Launcher" ✓ (dialog appeared)
- [~] Container list empty — bug: `setMessage()` + `setItems()` are mutually exclusive on Android; message view took over, items ListView never rendered → fixed in pre3
- [ ] Correct containers listed by name
- [ ] After picking, .desktop file written to container's desktop dir
- [ ] Shortcut appears in Ludashi side menu → Shortcuts
- [ ] Shortcut launches game correctly from Shortcuts list
- [ ] ShortcutSettingsDialog lets user customize Wine setup

---

## Session: 2026-04-08 — Container picker fix (v1.0.0-pre3)

### Bug
`AlertDialog.Builder.setMessage()` and `.setItems()` are mutually exclusive on Android.
The message TextView takes over and the items ListView is never rendered, so the
container picker dialog appeared empty even though containers loaded correctly.

### Fix
- `extension/LudashiLaunchBridge.java`: removed `.setMessage("Select a Wine container:")`
- Instruction folded into title: `"Select container for \"{gameName}\""`

### Commits & Builds
| Commit | Tag | Description | CI Run | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `8378d02` | v1.0.0-pre3 | fix: remove conflicting setMessage() so container list renders in picker dialog | [24158700638](https://github.com/The412Banner/Ludashi-plus/actions/runs/24158700638) | ✅ success |

## Session: 2026-04-08 — Steam Integration Phase 0 (CI Upgrade)

### Goal
Add Steam as a 4th game store tab. Phase 0 upgrades the CI to support Kotlin compilation and
JavaSteam JAR injection — the prerequisite for all subsequent Steam phases.

### What Changed (Phase 0)

**CI (`build.yml`) — complete rewrite:**
- Kotlin compiler auto-detection: detects Kotlin version bundled in base APK, downloads matching `kotlinc`
- JavaSteam download: fetches `javasteam-1.8.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` from JitPack
- `d8(javasteam.jar)` → classes18.dex (JavaSteam bundled separately)
- `kotlinc -no-stdlib extension/steam/*.kt` → d8 → classes19.dex+ (Steam Kotlin code)
- Java stores (GOG/Epic/Amazon) remain in classes17.dex (unchanged)
- Dynamic DEX index assignment: JavaSteam fills 18+, Kotlin Steam follows contiguously

**Resource patches:**
- `patches/res/menu/main_menu.xml` — added `main_menu_steam` item to `group_game_stores`
- `patches/res/values/public.xml` — added `main_menu_steam` = `0x7f09038b`
- `patches/res/values/ludashi_plus_ids.xml` — added `main_menu_steam` declaration

**Manifest patches:**
- Added `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_DATA_SYNC` permission
- Registered `SteamMainActivity`, `SteamLoginActivity`, `QrLoginActivity`, `SteamGamesActivity`
- Registered `SteamForegroundService` with `foregroundServiceType="dataSync"`

**Smali patch:**
- `patches/smali_classes8/.../MainActivity.smali` — added `const v4, 0x7f09038b` + `if-eq v1, v4, :start_steam` branch + `:start_steam` label block (starts `SteamMainActivity`)

**New files:**
- `extension/steam/SteamPlaceholder.kt` — smoke-test Kotlin file confirming CI compiles Kotlin

### Commits & Builds
| Commit | Tag | Description | CI Run | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `980737a` | v1.0.0-pre4 | feat: Phase 0 — Steam CI upgrade, menu wiring, manifest entries | [24165337471](https://github.com/The412Banner/Ludashi-plus/actions/runs/24165337471) | ❌ JitPack SNAPSHOT 0 bytes |
| `980737a` | v1.0.0-pre4 | (same — Gradle JitPack resolution also failed) | [24165396302](https://github.com/The412Banner/Ludashi-plus/actions/runs/24165396302) | ❌ javasteam.jar 0 bytes → ZipException |
| `c5450fc` | v1.0.0-pre4 | fix: build JavaSteam from source instead of JitPack download | [24165531623](https://github.com/The412Banner/Ludashi-plus/actions/runs/24165531623) | ✅ **success** |

### Root Cause Fixed (JavaSteam JAR)
- JitPack SNAPSHOT artifacts are build-on-demand; all direct wget and Gradle+JitPack resolution attempts returned 404 or 0 bytes on a cold CI runner
- Fix: clone LossyDragon/JavaSteam at depth 1 and run `./gradlew shadowJar` (fat JAR with all JavaSteam classes) directly in CI — fully reliable, no external artifact cache dependency
- Steam menu item, manifest entries, and SteamPlaceholder.kt Kotlin compile all pass ✅

---

## Session: 2026-04-09 — Steam Integration Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure)

### Goal
Implement Phase 1: SteamRepository, SteamForegroundService, and stub Activities.

### What Changed

**New files (`extension/steam/`):**
- `SteamRepository.java` — self-contained Java singleton wrapping JavaSteam SteamClient. Java (not Kotlin) to avoid Kotlin 2.2.0 metadata incompatibility. Owns SharedPreferences directly (no Kotlin dependencies). Handles connect/disconnect, callback pump on HandlerThread, auto-login with refresh token, login/logout, license list.
- `SteamPrefs.kt` — SharedPreferences singleton for Steam credentials (username, refreshToken, steamId64, displayName, etc.)
- `SteamEvent.kt` — sealed class event hierarchy: Connected, Disconnected, LoggedIn, LoggedOut, LoginFailed, SteamGuardEmailRequired, SteamGuardTwoFactorRequired, QrChallengeReceived, QrExpired, LibraryProgress, LibrarySynced, DownloadProgress, DownloadComplete, DownloadFailed
- `SteamGame.kt` — data class: appId, name, installDir, iconHash, sizeBytes, depotIds, type, isInstalled; computed headerUrl and iconUrl
- `SteamForegroundService.kt` — foreground service using `Notification.Builder` (not NotificationCompat); starts/stops SteamRepository
- `SteamMainActivity.kt`, `SteamLoginActivity.kt`, `QrLoginActivity.kt`, `SteamGamesActivity.kt` — Phase 1 stubs

**CI (`build.yml`) changes:**
- Java step: now compiles `extension/steam/*.java` alongside `extension/*.java`, with `javasteam.jar` on classpath
- Kotlin step: strips `META-INF/*.kotlin_module` from javasteam.jar (avoids "Kotlin metadata 2.2.0, expected 1.9.0" error), adds `ext_java_classes` to classpath so SteamRepository (Java-compiled) resolves

### Commits & Builds

| `55de913` | v1.0.0-pre5 | fix: SteamRepository self-contained (no SteamPrefs.INSTANCE dependency) | [24168048088](https://github.com/The412Banner/Ludashi-plus/actions/runs/24168048088) | ❌ .toLong() on primitive long |
| `f38465d` | v1.0.0-pre5 | fix: remove .toLong() — convertToUInt64() returns primitive long | [24168181587](https://github.com/The412Banner/Ludashi-plus/actions/runs/24168181587) | ❌ SteamRepository not on Kotlin classpath |
| `f93691a` | v1.0.0-pre5 | fix: strip javasteam Kotlin metadata; add ext_java_classes to Kotlin classpath | [24168366926](https://github.com/The412Banner/Ludashi-plus/actions/runs/24168366926) | ❌ initialize() missing Context arg |
| `d1e2496` | v1.0.0-pre5 | fix: pass Context to SteamRepository.initialize() | [24168527418](https://github.com/The412Banner/Ludashi-plus/actions/runs/24168527418) | ✅ **success** |

### Root Causes Fixed (Phase 1 debugging chain)
1. `-no-stdlib` removed stdlib from Kotlin compile classpath → must add `$HOME/kotlinc/lib/kotlin-stdlib.jar` explicitly
2. `in` is a Kotlin hard keyword → `import in.dragonbra.*` syntax error in Kotlin files → solution: write SteamRepository in Java instead
3. `./gradlew shadowJar` at repo root only produced the protobuf submodule JAR (no SteamClient) → fix: `./gradlew jar` all subprojects, then search for JAR containing `SteamClient.class`
4. JavaSteam latest master compiled with Kotlin 2.2.0; kotlinc 1.9.x rejects its metadata → Java bytecode interop has no metadata version check; writing SteamRepository in Java is the permanent fix
5. SteamRepository.java referenced `SteamPrefs.INSTANCE` (Kotlin class compiled in a LATER step) → must be fully self-contained with its own SharedPreferences helpers
6. `convertToUInt64()` returns primitive `long` in Java; calling `.toLong()` = dereferencing a value type
7. `javasteam.jar` still carries Kotlin metadata headers → strip with `zip -d javasteam.jar 'META-INF/*.kotlin_module'`; `ext_java_classes` not on Kotlin classpath → SteamRepository.class invisible to kotlinc
8. `SteamForegroundService.kt` called `initialize()` with no args; Java method requires `Context` → pass `this`

### Architecture Notes
- **SteamRepository.java is in Java, not Kotlin.** JavaSteam is compiled with Kotlin 2.2.0; kotlinc 1.9.x (matching base APK) cannot read Kotlin 2.2.0 metadata. Java bytecode interop bypasses this. This is the permanent architecture.
- **Kotlin metadata stripped from javasteam.jar before Kotlin compile step.** Class files remain functional as Java bytecode; only the Kotlin module metadata file is removed.
- **ext_java_classes on Kotlin classpath.** Java step runs first → Kotlin files can reference SteamRepository.

---

## Session: 2026-04-09 — Steam Integration Phase 2 (Credential Login UI)

### What Changed

**New: `extension/steam/SteamAuthManager.java`**
- Java singleton wrapping JavaSteam's `SteamAuthentication` API
- Implements `IAuthenticator` via anonymous inner class
- `getEmailCode` and `getDeviceCode` return `CompletableFuture<String>` that resolve when `submitGuardCode()` is called
- `acceptDeviceConfirmation()` returns `CompletableFuture<Boolean>` (informs UI, immediately resolves true)
- Main auth loop runs on dedicated thread; uses `CompletableFuture.get()` on `beginAuthSessionViaCredentials()` and `pollingWaitForResult()`

**Updated: `extension/steam/SteamLoginActivity.kt`**
- Full programmatic login UI: username/password EditTexts, Sign In button, QR button, progress spinner, status text
- `SteamAuthManager.AuthListener` callbacks: `onSteamGuardEmailRequired`, `onSteamGuardTotpRequired`, `onDeviceConfirmationRequired`, `onSuccess`, `onFailure`
- Steam Guard dialog with AlertDialog (email = text input, TOTP = numeric input)
- On success: `SteamRepository.loginWithToken()` + navigate to `SteamGamesActivity`
- Cancels auth in `onDestroy()`

### IAuthenticator API (discovered via javap)
```
CompletableFuture<String>  getDeviceCode(boolean)           // TOTP/mobile auth
CompletableFuture<String>  getEmailCode(String, boolean)    // email Steam Guard
CompletableFuture<Boolean> acceptDeviceConfirmation()       // mobile approval prompt
```
Note: method is `getDeviceCode`, NOT `getTotpCode` — only discovered via `javap -p`.

### Commits & Builds

### Root Causes Fixed (Phase 2 debugging chain)
1. `IAuthenticator` is a CompletableFuture-based API (not blocking, not Kotlin coroutines from Java's perspective)
2. `AuthSessionDetails.clientOSType` not `clientOsType` (field name)
3. `acceptDeviceConfirmation()` returns `CompletableFuture<Boolean>` not `Void`
4. TOTP method is `getDeviceCode(boolean)` not `getTotpCode(boolean)` — only visible via `javap -p`

## Session: 2026-04-09 — Steam Integration Phase 4 (Library Sync via PICS)

### Goal
Implement PICS-based library sync: after login, resolve owned games from license list → PICS package info → PICS app info → SQLite.

### What Changed

**Modified: `extension/steam/SteamRepository.java`**
- New imports: `License`, `PICSRequest`, `PICSProductInfo`, `PICSProductInfoCallback`, `KeyValue`, `Collections`, `ConcurrentHashMap`, `AtomicInteger`
- `licenses` field type changed from `List<Object>` to `List<License>`
- Sync state constants: `SYNC_IDLE=0`, `SYNC_PACKAGES=1`, `SYNC_APPS=2`
- `pendingPackages` / `pendingApps` — `ConcurrentHashMap<Integer, PICSProductInfo>` accumulators
- Registered `PICSProductInfoCallback.class` subscriber in `registerCallbacks()`
- `onLicenseList()` — now persists licenses to DB (`upsertLicense`) and calls `syncPackages()`
- `syncPackages(List<License>)` — builds `PICSRequest(packageId, accessToken)` list, calls `steamApps.picsGetProductInfo(emptyList, pkgRequests, false)`
- `onPICSProductInfo(PICSProductInfoCallback)` — two-phase switch:
  - `SYNC_PACKAGES`: accumulates packages; on `!isResponsePending()` extracts appIds from `kv.get("appids").getChildren()`, persists `linkLicenseApp`, emits `LibraryProgress:1:<n>`, calls `syncApps()`
  - `SYNC_APPS`: accumulates apps; on `!isResponsePending()` parses `common.name/type/icon` + depot IDs, skips non-game/non-DLC types, `upsertGame()`, emits `LibrarySynced:<count>`
- `syncApps(List<Integer>)` — builds `PICSRequest(appId)` list, calls `picsGetProductInfo(appRequests, emptyList, false)`
- `syncLibrary()` — public method for pull-to-refresh; re-runs `syncPackages()` from cached license list

**Modified: `extension/steam/SteamGamesActivity.kt`**
- Full programmatic ListView UI replacing Phase 1 stub
- `SteamRepository.SteamEventListener`: handles `LibraryProgress:*` (updates status bar), `LibrarySynced:*` (reloads game list), `LoggedOut`/`Disconnected` (finishes activity)
- Header: ← Back, "Steam Library" title, ↻ Refresh button (calls `syncLibrary()`)
- Status bar: shows sync phase + count
- ListView: game name + type badge (GREEN for game, ORANGE for DLC)
- Empty state text with guidance

**Modified: `.github/workflows/build.yml`**
- Removed "Inspect PICS API (temp)" step — no longer needed
