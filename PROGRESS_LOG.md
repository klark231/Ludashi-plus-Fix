# Ludashi-plus Progress Log

Build and modification history for Ludashi-plus — Winlator Ludashi v2.9 bionic with GOG, Epic Games, and Amazon Games store integration.

---

### [pre-release] — v3.1.2-pre2 — DLL-free rebuild + DRM-redistribution cleanup (2026-05-04)
**Branch:** `main` HEAD `f66875c` | **Tag:** `v3.1.2-pre2` | **Base APK:** `ludashi-3.0-lsfg-vk-base-v3.1.2` (republished, no DLL)

#### Why
v3.1, v3.1.1 stable, and v3.1.2-pre1 all shipped the proprietary `Lossless.dll` bundled inside `assets/lsfg_vk/Lossless.dll` (7,521,280 bytes). Per user direction: stop redistributing the DRM-encumbered binary. Users now provide their own DLL via Settings → Import Lossless.dll. The layer `.so` and manifest remain bundled (LGPL-clean from `FrankBarretta/lsfg-vk-android`).

#### Repo cleanup
- **PR #384 to `StevenMXZ/Winlator-Ludashi`** — updated to remove bundled DLL; PR body rewritten for manual-import-only flow.
- **History rewrite on `The412Banner/Winlator-Ludashi`** — `git filter-repo --path app/src/main/assets/lsfg_vk/Lossless.dll --invert-paths` against fresh `--mirror` clone, then force-pushed `feature/lsfg-vk` (`051e8b7` → `d945574`), `feature/lsfg-vk-restore` (`e6f47a0` → `89096c4`), `lsfg-vk-color-fix` (`3edf41d` → `f2e761a`). DLL removed from every commit reachable from any branch HEAD on both fork and upstream.
  - Caveat: orphaned-commit URLs (`raw.githubusercontent.com/.../<old-sha>/.../Lossless.dll`) still serve the file — fully expunging them requires GitHub Support per their docs.
- **6 LSFG-shipping releases on `The412Banner/Ludashi-plus` deleted** (releases + tags via `gh release delete --cleanup-tag`):
  - `v3.1.1`, `v3.1`, `ludashi-3.0-lsfg-vk-base-v3.1.2`, `ludashi-3.0-lsfg-vk-base-revert-test`, `test-lsfg-vk-base-build`, `ludashi-3.0-lsfg-vk-base`. ~14 APKs (~7 GB) of bundled-DLL distribution removed.
  - Pre-LSFG releases (v3.0.0, base-apk-3.0, v1.1.x) preserved — verified clean via APK central-directory scan.

#### Code changes (cherry-picked from `feature/lsfg-vk-restore@89096c4` onto `lsfg-vk-color-fix`)
- `LsfgVkManager.java`: dropped `ASSET_DLL`, `isBundledDllAvailable()`, `bundledDllSize()`. `ensureRuntimeInstalled` now sources only the user-imported global DLL (`filesDir/lsfg-vk/Lossless.dll`).
- `SettingsFragment.java`: dropped "Using bundled Lossless.dll" status branch. Status text is now "Imported: <path>" or "Lossless.dll not present. Import it to enable LSFG-VK."
- `XServerDisplayActivity.java`: dropped `isBundledDllAvailable` from quick-menu DLL availability check.
- Manual import path (button `BTImportLosslessDll`, `REQUEST_CODE_IMPORT_LOSSLESS_DLL`, `importGlobalLosslessDll`) preserved unchanged.

#### Build pipeline (all green)
1. `Winlator-Ludashi@lsfg-vk-color-fix` HEAD `21a6af0` (cherry-pick of `89096c4` on top of `f2e761a`). CI run **25332969874** ✅ → `app-debug.apk` 505 MB; verified no `Lossless.dll`, layer `.so` (2.5 MB) + manifest preserved.
2. Republished as `ludashi-3.0-lsfg-vk-base-v3.1.2` pre-release on Ludashi-plus (preserves build.yml line 39 reference).
3. Tag `v3.1.2-pre2` pushed → CI run **25333168037** ✅ (build job; build-variants skipped per `-pre` rule).
4. Locally signed `rebuilt-aligned.apk` via Termux apksigner with repo's `testkey.pk8`/`testkey.x509.pem` (workflow gap — fixed in #5).
5. **build.yml patched** (commit `f66875c`): signed APK now uploaded as artifact for ALL builds; `-pre` tags also auto-create a GitHub pre-release with the APK attached. Stable-tag behavior unchanged.
6. v3.1.2-pre2 GitHub pre-release published with locally-signed APK (manual for this run; automatic for future `-pre` tags).

#### Test artifacts
- Phone: `/storage/emulated/0/LudashiPlus-v3.1.2-pre2.apk` (512 MB, signed)
- GitHub: https://github.com/The412Banner/Ludashi-plus/releases/tag/v3.1.2-pre2

#### Awaiting on-device confirmation
- App installs + launches normally
- Settings → Import Lossless.dll picker works; status shows "Imported: …"
- LSFG-VK enabled on a container → game launches with FG (multiplier, flow scale, perf mode)
- Quick menu shows "Lossless.dll not found" guidance when no DLL imported
- Color rendering correct (channel-rework revert preserved); vkCmdPipelineBarrier2 shim still working on previously-broken devices

#### After green test
- Push `v3.1.2` tag (no `-pre`) → fires 5-APK matrix → publishes stable release with all variants
- Update README + master map for v3.1.2 stable note about manual DLL import requirement

### [DEPRECATED — release deleted, superseded by v3.1.2-pre2] — v3.1.2 — LSFG-VK layer rebuild (vkCmdPipelineBarrier2 shim) (2026-05-04)
**Branch:** `main` | **Tag:** `v3.1.2` | **Base APK:** `ludashi-3.0-lsfg-vk-base-v3.1.2`

#### Why
A user reported LSFG-VK didn't work on their device after v3.1.1 shipped. The proximate cause was that the bundled `liblsfg-vk-layer.so` was built from `FrankBarretta/lsfg-vk-android@93ff5e8` (v1.0.0-4), which assumes `VK_KHR_synchronization2` is available — many Adreno/Mali Vulkan 1.1/1.2 drivers don't expose it.

Upstream had landed a fix the same day (`b55b182`, "implement compatibility shim for vkCmdPipelineBarrier2 to support legacy Vulkan devices"), so the cleanest action was to bump our layer source pin and rebuild.

#### What changed
- `The412Banner/LLS@lsfg-vk-color-fix`: bumped `lsfg-vk-android` submodule from `93ff5e8` → `b55b182`. Pulls in: vkCmdPipelineBarrier2 compatibility shim, Android AHB-based frame generation for Vortek/Turnip, shaderFloat16, enhanced device feature probing.
- `The412Banner/LLS@lsfg-vk-color-fix`: slimmed `patches/0001-lsfg-vk-color-format-fix.patch` down. Round 1 functional patch (threading `pCreateInfo->imageFormat` into `LsContext`) was a confirmed no-op and the upstream restructure into `framegen/v3.1_src/` would have broken its file paths anyway. Kept: `VK_USE_PLATFORM_ANDROID_KHR=1` define (still needed for `framegen/src/core/image.cpp` AHB types). Added: `target_link_libraries(lsfg-vk PRIVATE log)` — upstream b55b182's new `__android_log_print` calls weren't linked.
- LLS CI run **25313482636** ✅ (1m22s) → liblsfg-vk-layer.so (26 MB unstripped, 2.5 MB stripped).
- `The412Banner/Winlator-Ludashi@lsfg-vk-color-fix`: dropped new stripped `.so` into `app/src/main/assets/lsfg_vk/android_arm64_v8a/liblsfg-vk-layer.so` (commit `05c28c7`).
- Winlator-Ludashi CI run **25313670588** ✅ (1m58s) → app-debug.apk (507 MB) → published as `ludashi-3.0-lsfg-vk-base-v3.1.2` on Ludashi-plus.
- Ludashi-plus build.yml: bumped `gh release download` tag to `ludashi-3.0-lsfg-vk-base-v3.1.2`.

#### What's unchanged from v3.1.1
- Pipetto channel-rework reverts still in place — color bug stays fixed
- All store integrations, splash screen, downloads UI, etc.

#### Deferred Round 1 cleanup — DONE
The deferred cleanup item from `project_lsfg_vk_color_fix.md` (revert the Round 1 layer patch next time we rebuild the layer) has been resolved as part of this release.

---

### [stable] — v3.1.1 hotfix — LSFG-VK color bug fix (2026-05-04)
**Branch:** `3.0-revert-test` | **Tag:** `v3.1.1` | **Base APK:** `ludashi-3.0-lsfg-vk-base-revert-test`

#### Problem
v3.1 stable shipped with an R↔B channel swap visible only when LSFG-VK was enabled — cyan skin tones in GTA V, orange wallpaper, green tints throughout the Wine desktop. Same APK with LSFG-VK off rendered correctly.

#### Round 1 — layer-side format threading (FAILED)
Hypothesis: `lsfg-vk-android/src/context.cpp:67-69` hardcoded RGBA for the layer's `frame_0`/`frame_1`/`out_n` intermediates and used `vkCmdBlitImage` (no swizzle) into a BGRA8 swapchain. Patched the layer to thread `pCreateInfo->imageFormat` from hooks.cpp into `LsContext::createContext`. Verified via `nm -D` that the format param reached the proprietary blob.

Test APK installed on device → **same colors**. Conclusion: proprietary Lossless framegen blob ignores the format param.

#### Round 2 — upstream channel-rework revert (WORKS)
Real root cause was two Pipetto-crypto commits merged into our Winlator-Ludashi base on 2026-05-03:

1. `89f805e` "VulkanRenderer: improve handling of swapped channels" — hardcoded swapchain to BGRA8, moved R↔B swap from fragment shader into image-view component mapping, removed `swapRB` from push constants.
2. `8d4cb01` "VulkanRenderer: only swap channels of window resources textures" — reverted the swapchain swizzle, instead allocates per-window WinTex images as `R8G8B8A8_UNORM` when swapRB=true; fully removed `swapRB` from `WindowPushConstants`.

After 8d4cb01: swapchain is BGRA8, per-window textures RGBA8, shader writes `outColor = c` (no swap). Display path works because the GPU/driver handles the format mismatch on present — but LSFG reads swapchain bytes raw and sees R-G-B-A semantically labeled BGRA → mismatched.

Reverted both commits on `The412Banner/Winlator-Ludashi@revert-channel-rework` (CI run **25300464326** ✅, 3m12s, 2026-05-04). Published the new base as release tag `ludashi-3.0-lsfg-vk-base-revert-test` on Ludashi-plus. Confirmed working on-device — colors correct in games and Wine desktop.

#### Source promotion
- Winlator-Ludashi: fast-forwarded `lsfg-vk-color-fix` to include the two reverts (commits `e6351bd` + `a6b10ce`).
- Ludashi-plus: `3.0-revert-test` branch + `build.yml` line 39 already points at `ludashi-3.0-lsfg-vk-base-revert-test` — no Ludashi-plus source changes needed beyond the base-APK tag swap.

#### What's unchanged from v3.1
Everything except the base APK: LSFG-VK feature flow, store integrations, downloads screen, splash screen, etc.

---

### [branch] — 3.0 — v3.0 base APK porting session (2026-04-30)
**Branch:** `3.0` | **Tag:** `3.0` (pre-release) | CI ✅ run 25171129287

#### What was done
- Added `base-apk-3.0` release to our repo with Winlator-Ludashi v3.0 `ludashi-bionic.apk` (505MB)
- Created `3.0` branch from `main` to test v3.0 compatibility
- Updated CI to download from `StevenMXZ/Winlator-Ludashi` tag `3.0` instead of `v2.9`

#### Patch compatibility fixes (5 CI runs to green)

**Run 1 — `da38758`** — `ci: switch base APK to Winlator-Ludashi v3.0`
- ❌ Failed: `public.xml` declared 24 resource IDs removed in v3.0

**Run 2 — `269f502`** — `fix(3.0): remove dead public.xml entries dropped in v3.0 base`
- Removed: shader effects (`CBEnableCRTShader/FXAA/NTSCEffect/ToonShader`), render options (`CBNativeRendering`, `FLGraphContainer`, `LBLColorAdjustment`, `LLNativeOptions`, `SBBrightness/Contrast/Gamma`, `SPRenderMode`, `Sep0-3`), HUD elements (`TVFpsBig/GpuLoad/HardwareStats/Renderer/WattsTemp`), `main_menu_contents`, layouts `frame_rating` + `screen_effect_dialog`
- ❌ Failed: `main_menu.xml` still referenced `@id/main_menu_contents`

**Run 3 — `65d2353`** — `fix(3.0): remove main_menu_contents item — dropped in v3.0`
- ✅ Build passed, 5 APKs published — but app crashed on launch

**Crash analysis — log_2026_04_30_08_53_03:**
- `NullPointerException` at `AppCompatDelegateImpl.createSubDecor()` → `ContentFrameLayout.setId()` null
- Root cause: our v2.9 `public.xml` store IDs `0x7f09038a-8b` collided with v3.0 resources (`withText`, `withinBounds`, `wrap`, `wrap_content`, `youtubeRadioButton`), corrupting AppCompat's internal view ID lookup
- Secondary cause: menu resource IDs shifted by 9 positions in v3.0 (`main_menu_about`: `0x7f09026c` → `0x7f090275`); our smali packed-switch had v2.9 values baked in

**Run 4 — `a7c2d90`** — `fix(3.0): rebase MainActivity.smali + public.xml on v3.0 resources`
- Replaced `patches/res/values/public.xml` with v3.0's own (4825 entries); store IDs appended at `0x7f09038f-0x7f090393`
- Replaced `patches/smali_classes8/com/winlator/cmod/MainActivity.smali` with v3.0 base; re-applied store if-eq blocks with updated IDs (GOG=`0x7f090392`, Epic=`0x7f090391`, Amazon=`0x7f090390`, Steam=`0x7f090393`)
- ❌ Failed: v3.0 `public.xml` declares `drawable/ab_0001`-`ab_0117` + `animated_background` which CI strips before rebuild

**Run 5 — `4092420`** — `fix(3.0): remove ab_* and animated_background drawable entries from public.xml`
- Removed 118 drawable entries (`ab_0001`-`ab_0117` + `animated_background`) that CI strips but v3.0 public.xml still declares
- ✅ **Full green** — build 6m14s + all 4 variants (~2min each)

**Run 6 — `25b0d15`** — `fix: start DEX injection at classes16 not classes17`
- ❌ All 4 store menu items crashed: `ClassNotFoundException: com.winlator.cmod.store.GogMainActivity`
- Root cause: v3.0 base has 15 DEX files (classes.dex–classes15.dex); we were injecting at classes17.dex, leaving a gap at classes16.dex. ART loads DEX sequentially and stops at the first missing entry, so our store extension was never loaded
- Fix: injection now starts at classes16.dex (Java stores), classes17.dex+ (JavaSteam), classes18.dex+ (Kotlin Steam), etc.
- ✅ **Green** — CI run 25168431777, all 5 APKs rebuilt

**Run 7 — `4a5345e`** — `feat: full-screen splash install screen`
- Replaced `DownloadProgressDialog` first-run popup with full-screen branded splash
- `SplashInstallActivity` is now the LAUNCHER; drives imagefs.txz + Wine + driver extraction via reflection + `OnExtractFileListener` proxy; reports live % progress
- Shows logo, status label, purple progress bar, % counter; Proceed button appears at 100%
- On Proceed: requests `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission, then starts MainActivity
- Already-installed fast-path: `finish()` before `setContentView` — no UI flash on repeat launches
- ✅ **Green** — CI run 25171129287, all 5 APKs rebuilt

#### Current APK state (as of `4a5345e` — 2026-04-30)
- Tag: `3.0` (pre-release)
- Branch: `3.0`
- 5 APKs live on release page
- App launch crash: **fixed**
- Store ClassNotFoundException: **fixed** (DEX gap closed)
- First-run splash: **added** (full-screen, branded, progress bar, Proceed + permissions)
- Next: device test — install `LudashiPlus-3.0.apk`, verify splash on first install, Proceed → permissions, then app opens normally on subsequent launches

#### v3.0 base changes that required patching
| Change | Impact |
|---|---|
| OpenGL renderer removed (→ Vulkan) | 24 dead resource IDs in public.xml |
| Contents tab removed | menu XML item + public.xml entry |
| Menu IDs shifted +9 (`0x7f09026c` → `0x7f090275`) | MainActivity.smali packed-switch rebased |
| New resources filled old ID slots | Store IDs reassigned to `0x7f09038f+` |
| `ab_*.png` still in v3.0 public.xml | 118 drawable entries stripped from patches public.xml |

### [stable] — v1.1.0 — APK variants + README + Genshin package fix (2026-04-11)
**Commit:** `8268b62` | **Tag:** v1.1.0 (force-updated) | CI ✅ pending

#### What changed since first v1.1.0 tag
- `d55079f` — docs: README updated — Steam added to subtitle/description, full Steam feature list, installation section updated (over-original possible but at your own risk), "Steam coming soon" removed, JavaSteam credited
- `eae06ab` — ci: initial variant build (sequential loop, all builds) — superseded
- `800ce86` — ci: parallel matrix variant builds — stable releases only; 4 workers (Vanilla/PuBG/Genshin/AnTuTu) run simultaneously via GitHub Actions matrix; pre-release builds unchanged (1 APK only); `rebuilt-aligned.apk` uploaded as 1-day artifact for variant jobs to consume
- `8268b62` — ci: fix Genshin package name casing (`com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact`)

#### 5 APKs produced on stable releases
| File | Package | App Name |
|---|---|---|
| `LudashiPlus-{tag}.apk` | `com.ludashi.benchmark` | Winlator Ludashi+ |
| `LudashiPlus-{tag}-Vanilla.apk` | `com.winlator.vanilla` | Winlator Ludashi+ Vanilla |
| `LudashiPlus-{tag}-PuBG.apk` | `com.tencent.ig` | Winlator Ludashi+ PuBG |
| `LudashiPlus-{tag}-Genshin.apk` | `com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact` | Winlator Ludashi+ Genshin |
| `LudashiPlus-{tag}-AnTuTu.apk` | `com.antutu.ABenchMark` | Winlator Ludashi+ AnTuTu |

---

### [stable] — v1.1.0 — Full Steam integration (2026-04-11)
**Commit:** `03c636a` | **Tag:** v1.1.0 | CI ✅ run 24285062079
#### What's in this release
- Steam login (username+password verified; QR needs testing)
- PICS library sync with cover art, developer, genres, Metacritic score, size
- Download speed picker: Safe 4 / Normal 8 / Fast 16 threads
- Pause/Resume download — persists DL_PAUSED state in DB across app restarts
- Cancel download — stops + deletes partial files immediately
- Stale DL_DOWNLOADING rows auto-cleaned via `SteamDepotDownloader.isDownloading()`
- Logout button in library header with confirmation dialog
- Auto-rotate on Steam library + game detail screens (configChanges, no recreation)
- Game library cached in memory; auto-syncs only if empty or >4 hours stale
- Manual Refresh button always triggers full PICS sync
- Installed/uninstalled state reflected immediately (cache invalidated on all write paths)
- steam branch merged to main via fast-forward; v1.0.6-steam-pre1 pre-release deleted

---

### [pre] — v1.0.6-steam-pre1 — Speed picker, depot fix, cancel reset (2026-04-10)
**Commit:** `c0353e7` | **Tag:** v1.0.6-steam-pre1 | CI ✅ run 24273964057

#### What changed (4 commits since rollback to b76cb88)
- `cb50889` — feat: download speed picker dialog shown before install — Safe (4 threads) / Normal (8) / Fast (16); `SteamGameDetailActivity.showDownloadSpeedPicker()`; `SteamDepotDownloader.installApp()` + `runInstall()` accept `threads: Int`
- `6f33826` — fix: AppItem now explicitly sets `os = "windows"` + `downloadAllArchs = true` — fixes "Couldn't find any depots to download" (`Util.getSteamArch()` returns device arch like `armv8l` on some devices, which filtered all Windows depots)
- `7048527` — fix: `getCachedGameRows()` calls `getAllGames()` not `.allGames` — Java cannot access Kotlin property by field name; caused NoSuchMethodError at runtime
- `c0353e7` — fix: cancel always resets UI — `CancellationException` was bypassing `onDownloadFailed` path; `finally` block with `completedNormally` flag now guarantees `DownloadCancelled` emitted regardless of exception type

#### Also included (from c9ea683 base)
- `SteamRepository.java`: `getCachedGameRows()` / `invalidateGameCache()` in-memory cache; `emit()` invalidates on `LibrarySynced:`, `DownloadComplete:`, `DownloadCancelled:`
- `SteamRepository.java`: `SteamCloud` + `SteamUserStats` fields + accessors (`getSteamCloud`, `getSteamUserStats`, `getCallbackManager`)
- `SteamDepotDownloader.kt`: `maxDownloads` + `maxDecompress` configurable (default 4)

#### Note
Branch rolled back to v1.0.5-steam-pre1 (b76cb88) first — removed broken Pluvia commits (ee16d42 + 7b2530e) that had compile errors. Features cherry-picked clean without the card UI rewrite.

#### Known issues (in release description)
- UI does not refresh after cancelling a download (button/bar reset on next open)
- QR code login untested
- Downloads may exceed listed MB size (shared Valve base depots 1/2/3 not counted in PICS size)
- After all fixes applied and features working correctly, branch will be merged to main

### Post-CI — v1.0.3-steam-pre1 — Cancel button + launch exe picker (2026-04-11)
- CI run: 24270078935 ✅ success — auto-published
- Commit: `23ff7e0`
- Cancel: installBtn toggles Install→Cancel(red); installApp() returns Runnable; cancel closes downloader + deleteDownload + DownloadCancelled event
- Launch: AmazonLaunchHelper.collectExe()+scoreExe() heuristic; single exe direct; multiple → picker dialog
- Remaining: QR login untested; progress bar edge cases; UI tweaks

### Session end — v1.0.2-steam-pre1 — 2026-04-10

**Active pre: v1.0.2-steam-pre1** | Commit: `a316d92` | CI: ✅ run 24264156261 | APK: 525MB live

#### What was done this session
1. `52e88ff` — fix: `@file:JvmName("ExecuteAsyncKt")` compat shim had wrong generated class name (`ExecuteAsyncKtKt` → `ExecuteAsyncKt`) — resolved `ClassNotFoundException` on download
2. `ad4399a` — fix: progress bar clamped to 0-99% during download; back-calculates totalExpected from `depotPercentComplete` when PICS sizeBytes=0 (was causing 200%+ display); emits 100% from `onDownloadCompleted` before installed state (was showing "installed at 40%")
3. `89e91cf` — ci: `gh release edit --draft=false --prerelease` after upload on existing-release path — releases were staying as drafts on retag (now auto-publishes)
4. `a316d92` — fix: Steam games now install to `getFilesDir()/imagefs/steam_games/<Title>/` = `Z:\steam_games\<Title>\` in Wine — same Z: drive as GOG/Epic/Amazon (was using external storage, unreachable from Wine)
5. Deleted `v1.0.1-steam-pre1` release + tag; re-released as `v1.0.2-steam-pre1`

#### What still needs doing
- Fix download cancel button (not yet implemented)
- Fix Launch button — `findExe()` scans for `.exe` but Linux-only games (e.g. Uplink) only have `.bin`; Windows games should work once launch flow is tested
- Download progress bar still has edge-case bugs (noted in release description)
- Various UI tweaks

### Post-CI — v1.0.1-steam-pre1 — Steam install path + progress + CI draft fix (2026-04-10)
- CI run: 24263828994 ✅ success — auto-published (workflow draft fix confirmed working)
- Commits: `ad4399a` progress fix | `89e91cf` CI draft fix | `a316d92` install path
- Steam install dir → `getFilesDir()/imagefs/steam_games/<Title>/` = `Z:\steam_games\<Title>\` in Wine
- Progress: clamped 0-99%, back-calc total from depotPercentComplete, 100% emitted on complete
- Next step: test new APK — verify Z: drive path, re-test download progress bar

### Post-CI — v1.0.1-steam-pre1 APK re-published (2026-04-10)
- CI run: 24261739303 ✅ success (re-triggered after APK was missing from release)
- Commit: `52e88ff` — no code change, release fix only
- Root cause: tag force-delete + re-push → CI uploaded APK as draft release → published with `gh release edit --draft=false`
- APK: `LudashiPlus-v1.0.1-steam-pre1.apk` (525MB) now live
- Next step: install, test Steam download pipeline with `@file:JvmName("ExecuteAsyncKt")` fix in place

## Session: 2026-04-08 — Game Stores Integration

### Research & Reverse Engineering (Passes 1–38)
- Full reverse engineering of Winlator Ludashi v2.9 bionic APK documented in `LUDASHI_MASTER_MAP.md`
- Mapped all 38+ passes of analysis covering: Activities, Fragments, Container system, XServerDisplayActivity launch pipeline, SharedPreferences schema, DefaultVersion constants, FEXCore/Box64 preset tables, FrameRating update intervals, env var build order
- Confirmed 3 consecutive clean passes → convergence declared

### Game Stores Feature Design
- Decision: Port BannerHub GOG/Epic/Amazon store Activities to Ludashi-plus
- Source: `~/bannerhub/extension/*.java` (29 Java files)
- Launch bridge: `LudashiLaunchBridge` uses reflection to call `ContainerManager.getContainers()` and start `XServerDisplayActivity` — no compile-time dependency on Ludashi classes

### Files Changed

#### Modified: `patches/res/menu/main_menu.xml`
- Added `group_game_stores` group (checkableBehavior=none) with 3 items:
  - `main_menu_gog` — "GOG"
  - `main_menu_epic` — "Epic Games"
  - `main_menu_amazon` — "Amazon Games"

#### Modified: `patches/res/values/public.xml`
- Added 4 new resource IDs:
  - `group_game_stores` = 0x7f090387
  - `main_menu_amazon` = 0x7f090388
  - `main_menu_epic` = 0x7f090389
  - `main_menu_gog` = 0x7f09038a

#### Modified: `patches/AndroidManifest.xml`
- Registered 9 new Activities:
  - `com.winlator.cmod.store.GogMainActivity`
  - `com.winlator.cmod.store.GogLoginActivity`
  - `com.winlator.cmod.store.GogGamesActivity`
  - `com.winlator.cmod.store.EpicMainActivity`
  - `com.winlator.cmod.store.EpicLoginActivity`
  - `com.winlator.cmod.store.EpicGamesActivity`
  - `com.winlator.cmod.store.AmazonMainActivity`
  - `com.winlator.cmod.store.AmazonLoginActivity`
  - `com.winlator.cmod.store.AmazonGamesActivity`

#### Modified: `patches/smali_classes8/com/winlator/cmod/MainActivity.smali`
- Added 3 `if-eq` branches before packed-switch in `onNavigationItemSelected()`:
  - `0x7f09038a` (GOG) → `startActivity(GogMainActivity)`
  - `0x7f090389` (Epic) → `startActivity(EpicMainActivity)`
  - `0x7f090388` (Amazon) → `startActivity(AmazonMainActivity)`

#### New: `.github/workflows/build.yml`
- Triggers on `v*` tags and `workflow_dispatch`
- Downloads Winlator-Ludashi v2.9 bionic APK from StevenMXZ/Winlator-Ludashi
- Decodes with apktool 2.9.3
- Applies patches/
- Compiles extension/*.java with android.jar + org.json → d8 → classes17.dex
- Injects classes17.dex into rebuilt APK
- Signs with AOSP testkey, uploads to GitHub release

### Build Process (Compilation Chain)
- `javac -source 8 -target 8 -cp android.jar:org-json.jar → ext_classes/`
- `d8 --release --min-api 26 → ext_dex/classes.dex`
- This is injected as `classes17.dex` into the APK zip after apktool build

### Launch Behavior (v1)
After game downloads in store Activity:
- `LudashiLaunchBridge.triggerLaunch(activity, exePath)` called
- Reflectively loads `ContainerManager`, gets first container
- Toast shows install path
- Starts `XServerDisplayActivity` with `container_id`
- Wine desktop opens — user navigates to exe manually

### Root Causes Fixed (CI debugging chain)
1. Wrong APK filename (`winlator-ludashi-bionic.apk` → `ludashi-bionic.apk`)
2. `ab_*.png` and `ab_gear_*.png` are raw animation frames, not valid PNGs — aapt1/aapt2 both reject them
3. `animated_background.xml` references the deleted pseudo-PNGs — must also be removed
4. `public.xml` in `patches/` retained entries for all deleted files → must remove them
5. New menu IDs (`group_game_stores`, `main_menu_gog/epic/amazon`) need explicit `<item type="id">` declaration in an ids.xml for aapt1
6. `GITHUB_TOKEN` needs `contents: write` permission for release creation in `workflow_dispatch`

### Signing
APK is signed with the AOSP public testkey (`testkey.pk8` / `testkey.x509.pem`, committed to repo). Fine for sideloading; not suitable for signature-verified updates. A private keystore stored as a GitHub Actions secret is the upgrade path if needed.

### Device Test Results (2026-04-08, v1.0.0-pre1)
- [x] Three store entries visible in nav drawer (GOG, Epic Games, Amazon Games) ✓
- [x] Store Activities open correctly from nav drawer ✓
- [x] GOG login/library/install pipeline works ✓
- [x] Download completes, game installed ✓
- [~] "Add to Launcher" booted Wine container directly (v1 behavior — no container picker, no shortcut written) → **fixed in v1.0.0-pre2**

---

## Session: 2026-04-08 — Container Picker + Shortcuts Integration (v1.0.0-pre2)

### Problem
"Add to Launcher" in v1 called `LudashiLaunchBridge.triggerLaunch()` which picked the first container and immediately booted `XServerDisplayActivity`. No shortcut was written, no container choice, user was dropped into a bare Wine desktop.

### Fix
Replaced launch behavior with shortcut creation:

1. **Container picker dialog** — `addToLauncher()` reflectively loads `ContainerManager.getContainers()`, builds a list of container names, shows `AlertDialog` for user to pick
2. **Shortcut file written** — after selection, `writeShortcut()` calls `Container.getDesktopDir()` via reflection, writes `{gameName}.desktop` to the container's Wine desktop directory
3. **Shortcut format** — standard Ludashi `.desktop` file:
   ```
   [Desktop Entry]
   Name={gameName}
   Exec={absLinuxExePath}
   Icon=
   Type=Application
   StartupWMClass=explorer

   [Extra Data]
   ```
4. **Success toast** — "Added to Shortcuts. Open side menu → Shortcuts to launch and configure it."

Shortcut appears in Ludashi's **Shortcuts** nav item. User can launch it and customize Wine setup (graphics driver, DX wrapper, emulator, etc.) via the native `ShortcutSettingsDialog`.

### Files Changed
- `extension/LudashiLaunchBridge.java` — replaced `triggerLaunch()` with `addToLauncher()` + `writeShortcut()`
- `extension/GogLaunchHelper.java` — `triggerLaunch()` → `addToLauncher(activity, name, path)`
- `extension/GogGamesActivity.java` — 4 call sites updated to pass `game.title`
- `extension/EpicGamesActivity.java` — `pendingLaunchExe(path)` → `pendingLaunchExe(name, path)`
- `extension/AmazonGamesActivity.java` — same as Epic

### Device Test Results (2026-04-08, v1.0.0-pre2)
- [x] Container picker shows on "Add to Launcher" ✓ (dialog appeared)
- [~] Container list empty — bug: `setMessage()` + `setItems()` are mutually exclusive on Android; message view took over, items ListView never rendered → fixed in pre3
- [ ] Correct containers listed by name
- [ ] After picking, .desktop file written to container's desktop dir
- [ ] Shortcut appears in Ludashi side menu → Shortcuts
- [ ] Shortcut launches game correctly from Shortcuts list
- [ ] ShortcutSettingsDialog lets user customize Wine setup

---

## Session: 2026-04-08 — Container picker fix (v1.0.0-pre3)

### Bug
`AlertDialog.Builder.setMessage()` and `.setItems()` are mutually exclusive on Android.
The message TextView takes over and the items ListView is never rendered, so the
container picker dialog appeared empty even though containers loaded correctly.

### Fix
- `extension/LudashiLaunchBridge.java`: removed `.setMessage("Select a Wine container:")`
- Instruction folded into title: `"Select container for \"{gameName}\""`

### Commits & Builds

## Session: 2026-04-08 — Steam Integration Phase 0 (CI Upgrade)

### Goal
Add Steam as a 4th game store tab. Phase 0 upgrades the CI to support Kotlin compilation and
JavaSteam JAR injection — the prerequisite for all subsequent Steam phases.

### What Changed (Phase 0)

**CI (`build.yml`) — complete rewrite:**
- Kotlin compiler auto-detection: detects Kotlin version bundled in base APK, downloads matching `kotlinc`
- JavaSteam download: fetches `javasteam-1.8.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` from JitPack
- `d8(javasteam.jar)` → classes18.dex (JavaSteam bundled separately)
- `kotlinc -no-stdlib extension/steam/*.kt` → d8 → classes19.dex+ (Steam Kotlin code)
- Java stores (GOG/Epic/Amazon) remain in classes17.dex (unchanged)
- Dynamic DEX index assignment: JavaSteam fills 18+, Kotlin Steam follows contiguously

**Resource patches:**
- `patches/res/menu/main_menu.xml` — added `main_menu_steam` item to `group_game_stores`
- `patches/res/values/public.xml` — added `main_menu_steam` = `0x7f09038b`
- `patches/res/values/ludashi_plus_ids.xml` — added `main_menu_steam` declaration

**Manifest patches:**
- Added `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_DATA_SYNC` permission
- Registered `SteamMainActivity`, `SteamLoginActivity`, `QrLoginActivity`, `SteamGamesActivity`
- Registered `SteamForegroundService` with `foregroundServiceType="dataSync"`

**Smali patch:**
- `patches/smali_classes8/.../MainActivity.smali` — added `const v4, 0x7f09038b` + `if-eq v1, v4, :start_steam` branch + `:start_steam` label block (starts `SteamMainActivity`)

**New files:**
- `extension/steam/SteamPlaceholder.kt` — smoke-test Kotlin file confirming CI compiles Kotlin

### Commits & Builds

| `980737a` | v1.0.0-pre4 | feat: Phase 0 — Steam CI upgrade, menu wiring, manifest entries | [24165337471](https://github.com/The412Banner/Ludashi-plus/actions/runs/24165337471) | ❌ JitPack SNAPSHOT 0 bytes |
| `980737a` | v1.0.0-pre4 | (same — Gradle JitPack resolution also failed) | [24165396302](https://github.com/The412Banner/Ludashi-plus/actions/runs/24165396302) | ❌ javasteam.jar 0 bytes → ZipException |
| `c5450fc` | v1.0.0-pre4 | fix: build JavaSteam from source instead of JitPack download | [24165531623](https://github.com/The412Banner/Ludashi-plus/actions/runs/24165531623) | ✅ **success** |

### Root Cause Fixed (JavaSteam JAR)
- JitPack SNAPSHOT artifacts are build-on-demand; all direct wget and Gradle+JitPack resolution attempts returned 404 or 0 bytes on a cold CI runner
- Fix: clone LossyDragon/JavaSteam at depth 1 and run `./gradlew shadowJar` (fat JAR with all JavaSteam classes) directly in CI — fully reliable, no external artifact cache dependency
- Steam menu item, manifest entries, and SteamPlaceholder.kt Kotlin compile all pass ✅

---

## Session: 2026-04-09 — Steam Integration Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure)

### Goal
Implement Phase 1: SteamRepository, SteamForegroundService, and stub Activities.

### What Changed

**New files (`extension/steam/`):**
- `SteamRepository.java` — self-contained Java singleton wrapping JavaSteam SteamClient. Java (not Kotlin) to avoid Kotlin 2.2.0 metadata incompatibility. Owns SharedPreferences directly (no Kotlin dependencies). Handles connect/disconnect, callback pump on HandlerThread, auto-login with refresh token, login/logout, license list.
- `SteamPrefs.kt` — SharedPreferences singleton for Steam credentials (username, refreshToken, steamId64, displayName, etc.)
- `SteamEvent.kt` — sealed class event hierarchy: Connected, Disconnected, LoggedIn, LoggedOut, LoginFailed, SteamGuardEmailRequired, SteamGuardTwoFactorRequired, QrChallengeReceived, QrExpired, LibraryProgress, LibrarySynced, DownloadProgress, DownloadComplete, DownloadFailed
- `SteamGame.kt` — data class: appId, name, installDir, iconHash, sizeBytes, depotIds, type, isInstalled; computed headerUrl and iconUrl
- `SteamForegroundService.kt` — foreground service using `Notification.Builder` (not NotificationCompat); starts/stops SteamRepository
- `SteamMainActivity.kt`, `SteamLoginActivity.kt`, `QrLoginActivity.kt`, `SteamGamesActivity.kt` — Phase 1 stubs

**CI (`build.yml`) changes:**
- Java step: now compiles `extension/steam/*.java` alongside `extension/*.java`, with `javasteam.jar` on classpath
- Kotlin step: strips `META-INF/*.kotlin_module` from javasteam.jar (avoids "Kotlin metadata 2.2.0, expected 1.9.0" error), adds `ext_java_classes` to classpath so SteamRepository (Java-compiled) resolves

### Root Causes Fixed (Phase 1 debugging chain)
1. `-no-stdlib` removed stdlib from Kotlin compile classpath → must add `$HOME/kotlinc/lib/kotlin-stdlib.jar` explicitly
2. `in` is a Kotlin hard keyword → `import in.dragonbra.*` syntax error in Kotlin files → solution: write SteamRepository in Java instead
3. `./gradlew shadowJar` at repo root only produced the protobuf submodule JAR (no SteamClient) → fix: `./gradlew jar` all subprojects, then search for JAR containing `SteamClient.class`
4. JavaSteam latest master compiled with Kotlin 2.2.0; kotlinc 1.9.x rejects its metadata → Java bytecode interop has no metadata version check; writing SteamRepository in Java is the permanent fix
5. SteamRepository.java referenced `SteamPrefs.INSTANCE` (Kotlin class compiled in a LATER step) → must be fully self-contained with its own SharedPreferences helpers
6. `convertToUInt64()` returns primitive `long` in Java; calling `.toLong()` = dereferencing a value type
7. `javasteam.jar` still carries Kotlin metadata headers → strip with `zip -d javasteam.jar 'META-INF/*.kotlin_module'`; `ext_java_classes` not on Kotlin classpath → SteamRepository.class invisible to kotlinc
8. `SteamForegroundService.kt` called `initialize()` with no args; Java method requires `Context` → pass `this`

### Architecture Notes
- **SteamRepository.java is in Java, not Kotlin.** JavaSteam is compiled with Kotlin 2.2.0; kotlinc 1.9.x (matching base APK) cannot read Kotlin 2.2.0 metadata. Java bytecode interop bypasses this. This is the permanent architecture.
- **Kotlin metadata stripped from javasteam.jar before Kotlin compile step.** Class files remain functional as Java bytecode; only the Kotlin module metadata file is removed.
- **ext_java_classes on Kotlin classpath.** Java step runs first → Kotlin files can reference SteamRepository.

---

## Session: 2026-04-09 — Steam Integration Phase 2 (Credential Login UI)

### What Changed

**New: `extension/steam/SteamAuthManager.java`**
- Java singleton wrapping JavaSteam's `SteamAuthentication` API
- Implements `IAuthenticator` via anonymous inner class
- `getEmailCode` and `getDeviceCode` return `CompletableFuture<String>` that resolve when `submitGuardCode()` is called
- `acceptDeviceConfirmation()` returns `CompletableFuture<Boolean>` (informs UI, immediately resolves true)
- Main auth loop runs on dedicated thread; uses `CompletableFuture.get()` on `beginAuthSessionViaCredentials()` and `pollingWaitForResult()`

**Updated: `extension/steam/SteamLoginActivity.kt`**
- Full programmatic login UI: username/password EditTexts, Sign In button, QR button, progress spinner, status text
- `SteamAuthManager.AuthListener` callbacks: `onSteamGuardEmailRequired`, `onSteamGuardTotpRequired`, `onDeviceConfirmationRequired`, `onSuccess`, `onFailure`
- Steam Guard dialog with AlertDialog (email = text input, TOTP = numeric input)
- On success: `SteamRepository.loginWithToken()` + navigate to `SteamGamesActivity`
- Cancels auth in `onDestroy()`

### IAuthenticator API (discovered via javap)
```
CompletableFuture<String>  getDeviceCode(boolean)           // TOTP/mobile auth
CompletableFuture<String>  getEmailCode(String, boolean)    // email Steam Guard
CompletableFuture<Boolean> acceptDeviceConfirmation()       // mobile approval prompt
```
Note: method is `getDeviceCode`, NOT `getTotpCode` — only discovered via `javap -p`.

### Root Causes Fixed (Phase 2 debugging chain)
1. `IAuthenticator` is a CompletableFuture-based API (not blocking, not Kotlin coroutines from Java's perspective)
2. `AuthSessionDetails.clientOSType` not `clientOsType` (field name)
3. `acceptDeviceConfirmation()` returns `CompletableFuture<Boolean>` not `Void`
4. TOTP method is `getDeviceCode(boolean)` not `getTotpCode(boolean)` — only visible via `javap -p`

## Session: 2026-04-09 — Steam Integration Phase 7 (Launch Bridge)

### Goal
Wire up the Launch button in `SteamGameDetailActivity` to `LudashiLaunchBridge`.

### What Changed

**Modified: `extension/steam/SteamGameDetailActivity.kt`**
- `onLaunchClicked()` now:
  1. Scans `game.installDir` tree for `.exe` files using `File.walkTopDown()`
  2. Skips paths containing redist/redistribut/vcredist/directx/etc.
  3. Picks the largest `.exe` found (heuristic: main executable is usually the biggest)
  4. Calls `LudashiLaunchBridge.addToLauncher(activity, gameName, exePath)`
     - Shows container picker dialog
     - Writes `.desktop` shortcut to selected Wine container desktop dir
     - Shortcut appears in Ludashi's Shortcuts nav item for launch + Wine config
- If no `.exe` found: Toast "No executable found in install directory"
- Helper method `findExe(File)` encapsulates the scan logic

### Architecture
Same pattern as GOG fallback exe scan (`GogDownloadManager` beta40). LudashiLaunchBridge handles all the Winlator reflection work — Steam detail activity just provides game name + exe path.

---

**STOP — Phase 7 complete. All 7 phases implemented. Ready for device testing.**

### What needs testing (v1.0.0-pre12)
1. Steam login (credential flow + Steam Guard)
2. Library sync — games appear in list
3. Game detail screen — header art loads, metadata shows
4. Install — depot download starts, progress updates, completes
5. Launch — exe scan finds game exe, container picker appears, shortcut written, game accessible from Shortcuts

---

## Session: 2026-04-09 — QR Code Login

### Goal
Implement QR code Steam login (was a stub Toast since Phase 1).

### What Changed

**New: `extension/steam/SteamQrAuthManager.java`**
- Java singleton wrapping `SteamAuthentication.beginAuthSessionViaQR()`
- `startQrLogin(QrAuthListener)` — starts auth on background thread
- `QrAuthListener` interface: `onQrReady(url)`, `onQrRefreshed(url)`, `onSuccess()`, `onFailure(reason)`
- URL rotation watcher: polls `getChallengeUrl()` every 3s, notifies UI when Steam rotates the QR (~30s cycle)
- `cancel()` — stops watcher and clears listener

**Updated: `extension/steam/QrLoginActivity.kt`** (replaced Phase 1 stub)
- 260dp QR bitmap generated via ZXing `QRCodeWriter` → `BitMatrix` → `Bitmap`
- Auto-refreshes QR when `onQrRefreshed()` fires (URL rotation)
- Retry button on failure
- Cancel/back button
- Instruction text: "Open the Steam app → ☰ → Sign in via QR code"

**Updated: `.github/workflows/build.yml`**
- Added `zxing-core-3.5.2.jar` download from Maven Central
- Added to javac `-cp`, d8 (bundled into classes17.dex), and kotlinc `-classpath`

### API Discovery
- `QRAuthSession` → actually `QrAuthSession` (lowercase r) — caught by CI javap inspection
- `getChallengeUrl()` ✓
- `setChallengeUrlChanged(IChallengeUrlChanged)` exists (not used — polling approach is sufficient)
- `beginAuthSessionViaQR(AuthSessionDetails)` ✓ (one-arg variant, no CoroutineScope needed)

## Session: 2026-04-09 — Steam Integration Phase 4 (Library Sync via PICS)

### Goal
Implement PICS-based library sync: after login, resolve owned games from license list → PICS package info → PICS app info → SQLite.

### What Changed

**Modified: `extension/steam/SteamRepository.java`**
- New imports: `License`, `PICSRequest`, `PICSProductInfo`, `PICSProductInfoCallback`, `KeyValue`, `Collections`, `ConcurrentHashMap`, `AtomicInteger`
- `licenses` field type changed from `List<Object>` to `List<License>`
- Sync state constants: `SYNC_IDLE=0`, `SYNC_PACKAGES=1`, `SYNC_APPS=2`
- `pendingPackages` / `pendingApps` — `ConcurrentHashMap<Integer, PICSProductInfo>` accumulators
- Registered `PICSProductInfoCallback.class` subscriber in `registerCallbacks()`
- `onLicenseList()` — now persists licenses to DB (`upsertLicense`) and calls `syncPackages()`
- `syncPackages(List<License>)` — builds `PICSRequest(packageId, accessToken)` list, calls `steamApps.picsGetProductInfo(emptyList, pkgRequests, false)`
- `onPICSProductInfo(PICSProductInfoCallback)` — two-phase switch:
  - `SYNC_PACKAGES`: accumulates packages; on `!isResponsePending()` extracts appIds from `kv.get("appids").getChildren()`, persists `linkLicenseApp`, emits `LibraryProgress:1:<n>`, calls `syncApps()`
  - `SYNC_APPS`: accumulates apps; on `!isResponsePending()` parses `common.name/type/icon` + depot IDs, skips non-game/non-DLC types, `upsertGame()`, emits `LibrarySynced:<count>`
- `syncApps(List<Integer>)` — builds `PICSRequest(appId)` list, calls `picsGetProductInfo(appRequests, emptyList, false)`
- `syncLibrary()` — public method for pull-to-refresh; re-runs `syncPackages()` from cached license list

**Modified: `extension/steam/SteamGamesActivity.kt`**
- Full programmatic ListView UI replacing Phase 1 stub
- `SteamRepository.SteamEventListener`: handles `LibraryProgress:*` (updates status bar), `LibrarySynced:*` (reloads game list), `LoggedOut`/`Disconnected` (finishes activity)
- Header: ← Back, "Steam Library" title, ↻ Refresh button (calls `syncLibrary()`)
- Status bar: shows sync phase + count
- ListView: game name + type badge (GREEN for game, ORANGE for DLC)
- Empty state text with guidance

**Modified: `.github/workflows/build.yml`**
- Removed "Inspect PICS API (temp)" step — no longer needed

## Session: 2026-04-09 — Steam Integration Phase 5 (Game Detail Screen)

### Goal
Implement game detail screen (header art, metadata, Install/Launch buttons) and wire up item clicks in the library list.

### What Changed

**New: `extension/steam/SteamGameDetailActivity.kt`**
- Receives `EXTRA_APP_ID` Intent extra; loads `SteamGame` from `SteamDatabase`
- Header image loaded async via `java.net.URL` + `BitmapFactory` (Steam CDN header.jpg)
- Shows: game name (22sp), type badge, size (Phase 6 will populate), install status
- Install button: "Install" (blue) when not installed, "Uninstall" (red) when installed
- Launch button: grayed/disabled until `isInstalled=true` (Phase 7 wires up LudashiLaunchBridge)
- `SteamEventListener`: handles `DownloadProgress:appId:done:total`, `DownloadComplete:appId`, `DownloadFailed:appId:reason` — updates progress bar + button states
- Phase 6 stub: Install button shows Toast "Download engine coming in Phase 6"
- Phase 7 stub: Launch button shows Toast "Launch coming in Phase 7"

**Modified: `extension/steam/SteamGamesActivity.kt`**
- Added `setOnItemClickListener` — tapping a row launches `SteamGameDetailActivity` with `EXTRA_APP_ID`

**Modified: `patches/AndroidManifest.xml`**
- Registered `SteamGameDetailActivity`

**Modified: `.github/workflows/build.yml`**
- Added "Inspect CDN/depot download API (temp)" step — discovers CDN/depot classes in JavaSteam JAR for Phase 6 implementation

## Session: 2026-04-09 — Steam Integration Phase 6 (Depot Download Engine)

### Goal
Implement full depot download: manifest IDs from PICS, depot key fetching, CDN download, VZip/LZMA decompression, file writing.

### What Changed

**Modified: `extension/steam/SteamDatabase.java`**
- DB version bumped 1 → 2 (triggers onUpgrade on existing installs)
- New `depot_manifests` table: (app_id, depot_id, manifest_id, size_bytes)
- `DepotManifestRow` inner class
- `upsertDepotManifest()`, `getDepotManifests(appId)` methods

**Modified: `extension/steam/SteamRepository.java`**
- Import `DepotKeyCallback`
- `depotKeys: ConcurrentHashMap<Integer, byte[]>` — depot decryption keys
- `getDepotKey(depotId)`, `requestDepotKey(depotId, appId)` methods
- `onDepotKey()` callback handler — stores key, emits `DepotKeyReady:<id>` or `DepotKeyFailed:<id>:<reason>`
- PICS SYNC_APPS: now also parses `depots/{id}/manifests/public/gid` + `maxsize` → `upsertDepotManifest()`; total size summed from depots and stored in `upsertGame()`
- `emit()` promoted to public (needed by SteamDepotDownloader)

**New: `extension/steam/SteamDepotDownloader.java`**
- Singleton download engine, 3-thread executor
- `installApp(appId, ctx)`: queues download, starts worker thread
- `pickCdnServer()`: GET Steam CDN list API, picks first CDN/SteamCache server with HTTPS; fallback = `lancache.steamcontent.com`
- `downloadAllDepots()`: for each depot: wait for key (30s poll), download manifest, parse files, download+decrypt+decompress each chunk, write at offset
- `downloadManifest()`: HTTPS GET `{cdn}/depot/{depotId}/manifest/{manifestId}/5`
- `decompressManifestBlob()`: auto-detects VZip / PKZIP / gzip / raw protobuf
- `parseManifest()`: `ContentManifest.ContentManifestPayload.parseFrom()` → list of `FileEntry` + `ChunkEntry`
- `downloadChunk()`: HTTPS GET `{cdn}/depot/{depotId}/chunk/{chunkGidHex}`
- `decryptChunk()`: AES-256-ECB via `javax.crypto.Cipher` (null key = pass-through)
- `decompressChunk()`: VZip → `decompressVZip()` → `lzmaDecompress()` via reflection (`org.tukaani.xz.LZMAInputStream`)
- Emits `DownloadProgress:<appId>:<done>:<total>`, `DownloadComplete:<appId>`, `DownloadFailed:<appId>:<reason>`

**Modified: `extension/steam/SteamGameDetailActivity.kt`**
- `onInstallClicked()` now calls `SteamDepotDownloader.getInstance().installApp(appId, ctx)`
- Uninstall also calls `File.deleteRecursively()` in background thread

**Modified: `.github/workflows/build.yml`**
- Removed CDN inspection step (no longer needed)

|---|---|---|---|---|
| `12430c3` | v1.0.0-pre11 | feat: Phase 6 — depot download engine | [24182600708](https://github.com/The412Banner/Ludashi-plus/actions/runs/24182600708) | ❌ emit() private; protobuf-java missing |
| `521a419` | v1.0.0-pre11 | fix: add protobuf-java.jar to javac classpath | [24182977284](https://github.com/The412Banner/Ludashi-plus/actions/runs/24182977284) | ❌ emit() fix not committed |

### Root Causes Fixed (Phase 6 debugging chain)
1. `emit()` was edited locally but never committed — pushed `private` to GitHub; fix: commit local change
2. `ContentManifest.parseFrom()` requires `com.google.protobuf.*` at compile time; plain `./gradlew jar` does not bundle transitive deps → download `protobuf-java-3.25.4.jar` and add to javac `-cp`

---

## Session: 2026-04-09 — QR Login + Runtime fixes

### Phase QR: QR Code Login (pre13)
- `SteamQrAuthManager.java` — singleton wrapping `beginAuthSessionViaQR()`; polls `getChallengeUrl()` every 3s; `QrAuthListener` interface; callbacks on main thread
- `QrLoginActivity.kt` — ZXing `QRCodeWriter` → 260dp Bitmap; auto-refreshes on URL rotation; retry on failure
- `build.yml` — added `zxing-core-3.25.4.jar` from Maven Central; bundled into classes17.dex
- Key: class is `QrAuthSession` (lowercase r)

### Runtime Fixes from logcat (log_2026_04_09_10_11_21)

**Fix 1: `NoClassDefFoundError: org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemUtils`**
- Root cause: `AuthSessionDetails.<init>` calls `HardwareUtils.getMachineName()` which needs `commons-lang3` at runtime. Same missing-transitive-dep pattern as protobuf-java.
- Fix: download `commons-lang3-3.14.0.jar`, add to javac `-cp` and d8 (bundled into classes17.dex)
- Affects both credential AND QR login paths

**Fix 2: `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` prompted at wrong time**
- Root cause: system auto-prompts when foreground service starts — poor UX (fires mid-first-run setup)
- Fix: `SteamMainActivity` now requests `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` explicitly on Android 13+ (SDK >= 33) before starting `SteamForegroundService`; proceeds regardless of grant/deny

| `bb72197` | v1.0.0-pre13 | fix: patch HardwareUtils.java to remove SystemUtils.IS_OS_ANDROID | [24195535199](https://github.com/The412Banner/Ludashi-plus/actions/runs/24195535199) | ✅ **success** |

**Fix 3: `NoSuchFieldError: IS_OS_ANDROID`**
- Root cause: `HardwareUtils.getMachineName()` (line 206) reads `SystemUtils.IS_OS_ANDROID` — this field does NOT exist in commons-lang3 3.14.0 (added in a later release). Even though we bundled commons-lang3, the field is missing.
- Fix: patch `HardwareUtils.java` in the JavaSteam source clone (before `./gradlew jar`) with `sed -i 's/SystemUtils.IS_OS_ANDROID/false/g'`. The Android branch is skipped; method falls through to hostname — fine for Steam auth.
- No need to upgrade commons-lang3 version.

**Installation clarification (release description updated)**
- Cannot install over top of original Ludashi 2.9 — different signing key (AOSP testkey vs original). Android rejects with signature mismatch.
- Correct flow: uninstall original → install Ludashi-plus. Winlator containers in external storage survive the uninstall.

**Fix 4: `NoClassDefFoundError: com.google.protobuf.ProtocolMessageEnum`** (logcat log_2026_04_09_10_37_24)
- Root cause: `protobuf-java.jar` was added to javac `-cp` (compile-time) but NOT to d8, so protobuf classes were absent from all DEX files at runtime. Same missing-transitive-dep pattern as commons-lang3.
- Stack: `SteamQrAuthManager.lambda$startQrLogin$4` → `ProtocolMessageEnum` → ClassNotFoundException
- Fix: add `protobuf-java.jar` to the d8 bundling step → lands in classes17.dex
- Affects both QR and credential login (both hit protobuf internally via JavaSteam auth)

| `66206c5` | v1.0.0-pre13 | fix: use JavaSteam's own protobuf from Gradle cache | [24197307442](https://github.com/The412Banner/Ludashi-plus/actions/runs/24197307442) | ✅ **success** |

**Fix 5: `NoClassDefFoundError: com.google.protobuf.RuntimeVersion$RuntimeDomain`** (logcat log_2026_04_09_11_00_01)
- Root cause: hardcoded `protobuf-java-3.25.4.jar` (3.x) doesn't have `RuntimeVersion` — that class only exists in protobuf 4.x. JavaSteam's generated protobufs (`SteammessagesAuthSteamclient`) reference it at static init.
- Fix: after `./gradlew jar`, find the exact protobuf JAR Gradle resolved from `~/.gradle/caches` and copy it as `protobuf-java.jar`. Removes the hardcoded 3.25.4 wget. Guarantees version alignment with JavaSteam.
- Rule: always pull transitive deps from the Gradle cache after building JavaSteam, never hardcode versions.

**Fix 6: `NoSuchFieldError: IS_OS_MAC_OSX_SONOMA`** (logcat log_2026_04_09_11_18_27)
- Root cause: The base APK (ludashi-bionic.apk) already bundles an **older** commons-lang3 in its own DEX files (classes.dex–classes16.dex). Android classloader finds that version first — the newer commons-lang3-3.14.0 in our classes17.dex is shadowed. `IS_OS_MAC_OSX_SONOMA` was added in 3.14.0 but the base APK's version predates it. `Utils.<clinit>` (line 67) crashes → entire Utils class fails to init → `steamClient` stays null → both QR and credential login show "Parameter ... null: steamClient".
- Fix: add sed patch in the JavaSteam build step for `Utils.java` (same approach as HardwareUtils.java): replace `IS_OS_MAC_OSX_SONOMA/VENTURA/MONTEREY/BIG_SUR` and `IS_OS_WINDOWS_11` with `false` before `./gradlew jar`. These are OS detection fields — hardcoding `false` means JavaSteam skips those OS branches (irrelevant on Android).
- Tag: v1.0.0-pre14

**Fix 7: `NoClassDefFoundError: Lkotlinx/coroutines/future/FutureKt;`** (logcat log_2026_04_09_11_38_03)
- Root cause: `SteamAuthentication.beginAuthSessionViaQR()` (line 110) calls `kotlinx.coroutines.future.await()` from `kotlinx-coroutines-jdk8`. The base APK has `kotlinx-coroutines-core` but NOT the `jdk8` extension — that artifact bridges Kotlin coroutines to `CompletableFuture`, which is irrelevant for a pure-Android app like Ludashi.
- Same missing-transitive-dep pattern as protobuf-java and commons-lang3.
- Fix: pull `kotlinx-coroutines-jdk8-*.jar` from Gradle cache after `./gradlew jar` (same pattern as protobuf-java), bundle into classes17.dex via d8.
- Tag: v1.0.0-pre15

| `6426037` | v1.0.0-pre15 | fix: bundle kotlinx-coroutines-jdk8 into classes17.dex | [24199127825](https://github.com/The412Banner/Ludashi-plus/actions/runs/24199127825) | ❌ jdk8 not in Gradle cache (merged into core in 1.7+) |

**Fix 8: "the steam client instance must be connected"** (logcat log_2026_04_09_12_09_19)
- Root cause: `SteamForegroundService.start()` and `SteamLoginActivity` are launched back-to-back synchronously. `SteamClient.connect()` is async — `ConnectedCallback` has not fired by the time the user taps QR Login (or even types credentials). `SteamAuthentication(steamClient)` enforces that the client is connected, so auth throws immediately.
- Fix: both `QrLoginActivity` and `SteamLoginActivity` now check `SteamRepository.isConnected` before starting auth. If not yet connected, register a `SteamEventListener`, wait for `"Connected"` event, then proceed. Listener removed in `onDestroy()` to prevent leaks.

| `15b66ff` | v1.0.0-pre17 | fix: wait for SteamClient connection before starting QR/credential auth | [24200643204](https://github.com/The412Banner/Ludashi-plus/actions/runs/24200643204) | ✅ **success** |

**Fix 9: QR screen spins indefinitely on "Connecting to Steam…"** (logcat log_2026_04_09_12_30_06)
- Root cause 1: `SteamRepository` was configured with `WEB_SOCKET` only. On networks where WebSocket to Steam's CM servers hangs, no `ConnectedCallback` ever fires. Fix: allow both `WEB_SOCKET` and `TCP` so JavaSteam can fall back.
- Root cause 2: No timeout on the connection wait — spinner ran forever. Fix: 30-second `Handler.postDelayed` in `QrLoginActivity` and `SteamLoginActivity`; shows error + Retry if not connected in 30s.

| `0a6cf33` | v1.0.0-pre18 | fix: TCP fallback + 30s connection timeout | [24201702454](https://github.com/The412Banner/Ludashi-plus/actions/runs/24201702454) | ✅ **success** |

**Fix 10: connection timeout too long + listener leak + no network error message** (logcat log_2026_04_09_12_30_06)
- Reduced CM connection timeout 30s → 10s; fixed Retry accumulating duplicate listeners; added reachability pre-check (HEAD store.steampowered.com); changed catch(Exception) → catch(Throwable) in pump to survive NoClassDefFoundError.

**Fix 11: three-state network diagnosis** (no internet / Steam blocked / CM blocked)
- Reachability check now pings connectivitycheck.gstatic.com first, then api.steampowered.com, then CM port. Shows actionable message per case.

**Fix 12: CM connection never established** — withDirectoryFetch(true) + auto-reconnect
- `SteamConfiguration` was missing `withDirectoryFetch(true)` → CM server list never fetched → `getNextServerCandidate()` returned null immediately → DisconnectedCallback fired with no network attempt. Fixed. Also added up to 5 auto-reconnect retries with backoff.

**Fix 13: crash on Steam connect — use TCP-only**
- WebSocket in JavaSteam requires `io.ktor.client.engine.cio.CIO` which is not in our DEX → hard crash in WebSocketConnection.connect(). Switched to TCP-only (`ProtocolTypes.TCP`).

**Fix 14: `NoClassDefFoundError: kotlin.enums.EnumEntriesKt`** (logcat log_2026_04_09_13_xx)
- `ServerQuality.kt` in JavaSteam uses `enumEntries()` (Kotlin 1.9+ API) which references `EnumEntriesKt`. Base APK's Kotlin stdlib predates 1.9.
- Note: TCP WAS connecting and receiving Steam packets by this point; crash happened during packet processing.
- Fix: extract `kotlin/enums/` package from our kotlinc stdlib JAR and bundle into classes17.dex.

**Steam grayed out (pre24)** — remaining JavaSteam compat issues deferred
- After fixing EnumEntriesKt, further compat issues remained. Steam menu item temporarily disabled (`android:enabled="false"`, title = "Steam (Coming Soon)") to prevent crashes while other stores are tested.

## Session: 2026-04-09 — GOG Launch Fix

**Fix: GOG shortcut "file not found" when launching from Shortcuts** (logcat log_2026_04_09_14_42_04)
- Root cause: `Shortcut.java:85` parses `Exec=` by calling `execArgs.substring(execArgs.lastIndexOf("wine ") + 4)`. `LudashiLaunchBridge` was writing `Exec=/data/user/0/.../game.exe` — no "wine " prefix → `lastIndexOf()` returns -1 → `substring(3)` = garbage path → Wine reports "file not found".
- Fix: convert Android absolute path to Wine Z: drive path (`/foo/bar` → `Z:\foo\bar`), escape each `\` as `\\\\` for `.desktop` file format (so `Shortcut.unescape()` restores single `\`), write `Exec=wine Z:\\\\data\\\\...\\\\game.exe`.
- File changed: `extension/LudashiLaunchBridge.java` — `writeShortcut()` content generation.

**Fix 2: Z: drive maps imagefs, not /** (logcat log_2026_04_09_15_02_33)
- Winlator maps Z: to `container.getRootDir()/../..` = `imagefs/` (WineUtils.java:22), NOT to `/`. Games at `filesDir/gog_games/` are outside imagefs and unreachable by Wine.
- Fix: `GogInstallPath.getInstallDir()` now installs to `filesDir/imagefs/gog_games/<name>/`. Added `GogInstallPath.toWinePath()` to strip imagefs prefix and return `Z:\gog_games\...\game.exe`. `LudashiLaunchBridge` uses `toWinePath()`.
- Games previously downloaded to the old path must be re-downloaded.

**Diagnosis: launch confirmed working** (logcat log_2026_04_09_15_38_52)
- `winhandler.exe` correctly finds and executes `ELDERBORN.exe` at `imagefs/gog_games/ELDERBORN/` — path fix verified working.
- Remaining "not found" was a container mismatch: first launch used arm64ec native Wine (xuser-2) which can't run x86 Unity games → `UnityCrashHandler` fires in 1 second. Second launch used Proton 9.0 x86_64 via box64 (xuser-1) and loaded DLLs cleanly. Not a code bug — user must select the x86/Proton container when adding the shortcut.

### pre1 fix — 2026-04-10 — Null-safe PICS + disconnect fix (`7e6b122`)
- `kvStr()` helper: all `asString()` calls in PICS handler are now null-safe (NPE was crashing sync)
- `SteamGamesActivity`: only `finish()` on LoggedOut, not Disconnected; sync kickstart on empty DB
- Type filter broadened (tool/hardware/music/video/advertising excluded; everything else shown)

### pre1 update — 2026-04-10 — Games filter + cover art (`b8099da`)
- Only type="game" shown in library list
- Status count from games.size (not sync event count)
- Portrait cover art per row (async, LruCache)

## Session: 2026-04-10 — Steam Download Engine

> **Log discipline:** update this file both before pushing a CI build (record what was changed and why) and after it completes (record result). If the session crashes between push and CI result, the pre-push entry is the rollback reference.

### Context
Steam library listing and login were working. Attempting to download a game (FlatOut 2, appId=2990) failed with:
- `GetCDNAuthToken HTTP 404` — wrong protobuf field names in `input_json` (`appid` should be `app_id`, `depotid` → `depot_id`, `branch` → `app_branch`)
- After fixing field names (commit `a7c1040`): manifest fetch returned HTTP 401 because Steam CDN requires a manifest request code obtained via the CM connection, not the Web API

### Decision: Replace hand-rolled downloader with JavaSteam DepotDownloader
Rather than continuing to debug the auth chain manually (CDN tokens + manifest codes + depot keys), replaced the entire `SteamDepotDownloader.java` with a Kotlin object that delegates to JavaSteam's built-in `DepotDownloader` class (`javasteam-depotdownloader` module). This handles all auth internally through the existing CM connection.

**Rollback point:** commit `a7c1040` (tag `v1.0.1-steam-pre1` before force-retag) — last working build before DepotDownloader integration; Web API field names correct but still gets HTTP 401 on manifests.

### Changes
- **Deleted:** `extension/steam/SteamDepotDownloader.java`
- **Created:** `extension/steam/SteamDepotDownloader.kt` — Kotlin `object` using `DepotDownloader(steamClient, licenses, androidEmulation=true, maxDownloads=4, maxDecompress=4)`; full `IDownloadListener` callbacks with debug logging; blocks on `getCompletion().get()`
- **Modified:** `SteamRepository.java` — added `getSteamClient()` public getter (line 699); removed duplicate getter (line 707, fix commit `cc53d56`)
- **Modified:** `SteamGameDetailActivity.kt` — updated to use Kotlin object directly (no `getInstance()`)
- **Modified:** `.github/workflows/build.yml` — new step "Bundle DepotDownloader → DEX" that gathers `javasteam-depotdownloader.jar` + 11 transitive deps (ktor-client-cio, ktor-client-core, ktor-io, ktor-http, ktor-utils, ktor-network, ktor-network-tls, okio, kotlinx-io-core, kotlinx-serialization-json, kotlinx-serialization-core) and d8s them as a new DEX injected after the Kotlin Steam DEX; new step "Inject DepotDownloader DEX"

### Crash analysis — log_2026_04_10_11_53_29 (installed `3ad6b2e`)
**Primary:** `NoClassDefFoundError: okhttp3.coroutines.ExecuteAsyncKt` at `Client.kt:137`
- javasteam CDN `Client.kt` uses OkHttp3 with coroutines extension (`executeAsync()`) to fetch manifests
- We bundled Ktor CIO + Okio but forgot OkHttp entirely — OkHttp is a separate dep used by the main javasteam library, not DepotDownloader itself
- Fix: `gather_jar "okhttp-[0-9]*.jar"` + `gather_jar "okhttp-coroutines-*.jar"` added to CI; Maven fallback = 5.0.0-alpha.14

**Secondary:** `IllegalStateException: SteamDatabase not initialised` at `SteamDatabase.java:109`
- Process killed by crash → ForegroundService restarted in fresh process → `SteamGamesActivity.onCreate` called `SteamRepository.getDatabase()` before `SteamRepository.initialize(ctx)` had run
- Fix: `getDatabase()` now passes `appContext` to `SteamDatabase.getInstance(ctx)` when it's non-null (lazy init path)

### Current APK state (as of 185e11b — 2026-04-10)
- Tag: `v1.0.1-steam-pre1` (force-tagged through all fixes)
- Branch: `steam`
- Install attempt result: pending device test
- Next expected failure point (if any): another missing transitive dep or a runtime error inside DepotDownloader itself

### Pre-push entry — 2026-04-10 — okhttp-coroutines compat shim + restart crash fix

**Crash analysis — log_2026_04_10_12_12_38 (installed `185e11b`):**

**Primary:** `NoSuchMethodError: CancellableContinuation.resume(Object, Function3)` at `ExecuteAsync.kt:46`
- `okhttp-coroutines.jar` was compiled with Kotlin 2.x / coroutines 1.9+ which added a new `resume(value, onCancellation: Function3)` overload
- Base APK has older coroutines — this method doesn't exist → NoSuchMethodError
- Cannot override base APK's coroutines classes (DexClassLoader loads base APK first)
- Fix: write compat shim `extension/steam/compat/ExecuteAsyncKt.kt` in `okhttp3.coroutines` package using `Continuation.resumeWith(Result.success(...))` from stdlib (always available); exclude `okhttp-coroutines.jar` from runtime DEX bundle

**Secondary:** `SteamDatabase not initialised` crash on restart (same as before — fix was incomplete)
- `appContext` is null in a freshly-restarted process so the `if (appContext != null)` guard falls through to the throwing path
- Fix: `SteamGamesActivity.loadGames()` now catches `IllegalStateException`, redirects to `SteamMainActivity`, and finishes

**Files changed:**
- `extension/steam/compat/ExecuteAsyncKt.kt` — NEW — compat shim for `okhttp3.coroutines.executeAsync`
- `.github/workflows/build.yml` — exclude `okhttp-coroutines.jar` from d8 bundle
- `extension/steam/SteamGamesActivity.kt` — catch IllegalStateException in `loadGames()`, redirect to SteamMainActivity

### Pre-push entry — 2026-04-10 — Fix OkHttp Maven download + multi-version fallback

**CI failure analysis (okhttp-coroutines compat build):**
- `okhttp.jar` download returned HTML (404 page) — `5.0.0-alpha.14` doesn't exist or isn't resolvable on Maven Central for our URL format
- `zip -d` on corrupt HTML file → "Zip file structure invalid"
- kotlinc then failed with "unresolved reference: Call/Callback/Response" because `okhttp.jar` on DEPOT_CP was invalid/zero-size

**Fix:**
- `gather_jar` now uses `version="MULTI"` for okhttp/okhttp-coroutines
- Multi-version loop tries `5.0.0` → `5.0.0-alpha.14` → `5.0.0-alpha.11` → `4.12.0` in order, validates each with `jar tf` before accepting
- Single-version downloads also now validated with `jar tf` before accepting

### Post-CI update — 2026-04-10 — compat shim series complete

| Commit | Tag | Description | CI Run | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `1d2a5f8` | v1.0.1-steam-pre1 | feat: okhttp-coroutines compat shim + SteamGamesActivity restart fix | CI | ❌ okhttp.jar invalid (HTML 404) |
| `2419690` | v1.0.1-steam-pre1 | fix: multi-version OkHttp Maven fallback + JAR validation | CI | ❌ okhttp-jvm not matched by okhttp-[0-9]* pattern |
| `a81b303` | v1.0.1-steam-pre1 | fix: detect okhttp3 in javasteam.jar; group path cache search | CI | ❌ kotlinc IR optimizer crash on CancellableContinuation |
| `ae532ca` | v1.0.1-steam-pre1 | fix: suspendCoroutine shim + okhttp-jvm artifact name | CI | ✅ **success** |

**Lessons from okhttp chain:**
- OkHttp 5.x uses `okhttp-jvm` artifact (KMP naming), not `okhttp`
- `okhttp-jvm-5.1.0.jar` is in Gradle cache at `com.squareup.okhttp3/okhttp-jvm/5.1.0/`
- kotlinc 1.9 IR optimizer crashes when `-Xskip-metadata-version-check` is active and code calls `CancellableContinuation.resumeWith(Result.success(...))` — IR const-expr transformer hits AssertionError
- Fix: use `suspendCoroutine` (stdlib) → plain `Continuation<T>` → no coroutines library version dependency, no IR issue

**Current APK state (as of ae532ca — 2026-04-10):**
- Tag: `v1.0.1-steam-pre1`
- okhttp-coroutines compat shim in place, okhttp-jvm 5.1.0 bundled in DepotDownloader DEX
- SteamGamesActivity handles uninit restart gracefully
- Ready for download test

### Crash analysis — log_2026_04_10_14_09_55 (OLD APK — pre-compat shim)
- Timestamps 14:09 confirm this is the `185e11b` APK — `ae532ca` (compat shim) wasn't built until 16:40
- Both crashes: `ClassNotFoundException: okhttp3.coroutines.ExecuteAsyncKt` — expected, the shim wasn't in `185e11b`
- User needs to install the `ae532ca` APK from `v1.0.1-steam-pre1` release

### Notes from Steam Integration Report (GameNative reference)
From section 5.3 / 2.2:
- GameNative passes `OkHttpClient` to `SteamConfiguration.withHttpClient(...)` — we currently do not; may need this if CM connection uses HTTP for certain operations
- `getCompletion().await()` used by GameNative (coroutine, non-blocking) vs our `.get()` (blocking on IO thread) — functionally fine on IO thread but could adopt await() later
- `CaseInsensitiveFileSystem()` passed to DepotDownloader — GameNative uses this for Windows game file compatibility; we don't pass it currently → could cause issues if game has mixed-case file references
- GameNative uses `ProtocolTypes.WEB_SOCKET` for CM connection; we use TCP — not related to download but worth noting
- These improvements are queued for after basic download is confirmed working

### Crash analysis — log_2026_04_10_14_30_10 (ae532ca APK or still 185e11b?)
- **Same error:** `NoClassDefFoundError: Failed resolution of: Lokhttp3/coroutines/ExecuteAsyncKt;`
- Root cause FOUND: the compat shim file is named `ExecuteAsyncKt.kt` → Kotlin adds `Kt` suffix → generated class is `okhttp3.coroutines.ExecuteAsyncKtKt` not `ExecuteAsyncKt`
- Runtime lookup for `okhttp3.coroutines.ExecuteAsyncKt` fails — wrong class name in DEX
- Fix: add `@file:JvmName("ExecuteAsyncKt")` at top of `ExecuteAsyncKt.kt` to override generated class name

### Pre-push — fix: @file:JvmName("ExecuteAsyncKt") compat shim class name (2026-04-10)
- Files: `extension/steam/compat/ExecuteAsyncKt.kt`
- Tag: v1.0.1-steam-pre1 (retag after push)
- Expected: classes22.dex now contains `okhttp3/coroutines/ExecuteAsyncKt` (not `ExecuteAsyncKtKt`)
- CI pending

### Post-CI — fix: @file:JvmName("ExecuteAsyncKt") (2026-04-10)
- Run: 24258524277 ✅ success (7m1s)
- Commit: `52e88ff` | Tag: `v1.0.1-steam-pre1`
- Root cause: `ExecuteAsyncKt.kt` filename → Kotlin generates `ExecuteAsyncKtKt` → @file:JvmName forces correct `ExecuteAsyncKt`
- classes22.dex now has correct class name — should resolve ClassNotFoundException at runtime
- **Next step:** install this APK, try downloading a game, check debug log + logcat

## v3.0.0 — 3.0 branch porting session (2026-04-30)

### Context
StevenMXZ released Ludashi v3.0 on 2026-04-30 with a full Vulkan renderer rewrite,
ContentManager restructure, and removal of the Contents tab. Branched `3.0` from `main`
and ported all patches to the new base APK (`ludashi-bionic.apk` 505MB, uploaded to
`base-apk-3.0` release on our repo).

## store-update branch — GOG/Epic/Amazon store enhancements (2026-04-30)

### Goal
Port GOG/Epic/Amazon game detail screens, cloud save managers, and Epic free games
from BannerHub. Replace BH-specific `BhDownloadService` (foreground service) with a
new `StoreDownloadQueue` in-process singleton. Add DownloadsActivity accessible from
main menu.

### New files added
- `extension/GogGameDetailActivity.java` — ported + patched (BhDownloadService → StoreDownloadQueue, launch → GogLaunchHelper.addToLauncher)
- `extension/GogCloudSaveManager.java` — ported (package rename only, clientId falls back to galaxyToken)
- `extension/EpicGameDetailActivity.java` — ported + patched (pendingLaunchExe → LudashiLaunchBridge.addToLauncher)
- `extension/EpicCloudSaveManager.java` — ported (package rename only)
- `extension/EpicFreeGamesActivity.java` — ported (package rename only, fully standalone)
- `extension/AmazonGameDetailActivity.java` — ported + patched
- `extension/StoreDownloadQueue.java` — NEW: in-process download singleton replacing BhDownloadService
- `extension/DownloadsActivity.java` — NEW: polls StoreDownloadQueue every 1s, shows progress cards

### Files modified
- `extension/GogGamesActivity.java` — added HashMap import, gogDlcBuffer field, REQ_GAME_DETAIL/REQ_DOWNLOADS constants, openDetailScreen(), onActivityResult()
- `extension/EpicGamesActivity.java` — same additions
- `extension/AmazonGamesActivity.java` — same additions
- `patches/res/menu/main_menu.xml` — added Downloads item to group_game_stores
- `patches/res/values/public.xml` — added `main_menu_downloads` ID at `0x7f090394`
- `patches/res/values/ludashi_plus_ids.xml` — added `main_menu_downloads` item definition
- `patches/AndroidManifest.xml` — declared all 5 new activities
- `patches/smali_classes8/.../MainActivity.smali` — added if-eq for `0x7f090394` → DownloadsActivity

### CI run table (store-update)

| `e1683da` | fix: add main_menu_downloads to ludashi_plus_ids.xml | 25181177753 | ✅ **success** |

### Post-green enhancements (same session)

| Commit | Description | CI Run | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| `72c9a6f` | feat: add download notifications + wire detail screens to card taps | 25183066096 | ✅ **success** |

**Detail screen wiring:** All 3 GamesActivity files — list card (second tap when expanded) and grid tile (long press) now call `openDetailScreen(game)` instead of the old inline AlertDialog.

**Download notifications:** `StoreDownloadQueue` now posts an ongoing Android progress notification for each download. Shows store + title, progress bar, Cancel action button. Throttled per % change. On finish: dismissed (cancelled), static error card, or static complete card. BroadcastReceiver registered dynamically on first download start, unregistered when all downloads finish. Uses `RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED` on API 33+.

### Current state (2026-04-30)
- Branch: `store-update`, latest commit: `72c9a6f`
- CI: ✅ green (run 25183066096)
- Ready to merge into `3.0` when user confirms device test

### Pre-push — fix: route all list/grid downloads through StoreDownloadQueue for notifications (2026-04-30)

**Problem:** Android progress notifications only appeared when installing from GameDetailActivity,
not from the games list. Root cause: all 7 list/grid Install buttons (GOG list, GOG grid, GOG
custom-install dialog, Epic list, Epic grid, Amazon list, Amazon grid) called
`GogDownloadManager.startDownload()` / `startEpicDownload()` / `startAmazonDownload()` directly,
bypassing `StoreDownloadQueue` entirely.

**Fix:** All 7 sites now route through `StoreDownloadQueue.startGog/Epic/Amazon()`. The in-place
UI (progress bar, status text, checkmark) is delivered via `StoreDownloadQueue.addListener(dlKey, ...)`.
Cancel buttons call `StoreDownloadQueue.cancel() + removeListener()`. Each site gets a unique dlKey:
- `gog-{gameId}-list`, `gog-{gameId}-grid`, `gog-{gameId}-custom`
- `epic-{appName}-list`, `epic-{appName}-grid`
- `amz-{productId}-list`, `amz-{productId}-grid`

Files changed: GogGamesActivity.java (3 sites), EpicGamesActivity.java (2 sites),
AmazonGamesActivity.java (2 sites)

CI pending.

### Post-CI — fix: route all list/grid installs through StoreDownloadQueue (2026-04-30)
- Commit: `ba5fe10` | CI run: 25183887535 ✅ success
- All 7 download sites now go through StoreDownloadQueue → notifications fire for every install path
- store-update branch: latest commit `ba5fe10`, all CI green

### Pre-push — feat: Downloads header button + in-progress restore on card build (2026-04-30)

**Downloads button:** Add "⬇" button to the header row of GogGamesActivity, EpicGamesActivity,
AmazonGamesActivity. Taps open DownloadsActivity via startActivityForResult(REQ_DOWNLOADS).
Same styling as existing header buttons.

**Progress restore:** When addGameCard() / makeGridTile() builds a card, check
StoreDownloadQueue.getEntry(dlKey) — if a download is active for that game, immediately
restore the in-progress UI (expand section visible, Cancel button, live progress bar/status)
and re-register a fresh DownloadListener. Covers all 7 download paths (GOG list/grid/custom,
Epic list/grid, Amazon list/grid). Requires adding getEntry(dlKey) to StoreDownloadQueue.

CI pending.

### Post-CI — feat: Downloads button + in-progress restore (2026-04-30)
- Commit: `6702f07` | CI run: 25185022012 ✅ success
- ⬇ Downloads button added to GOG/Epic/Amazon headers → opens DownloadsActivity
- All 6 list/grid card-build sites check StoreDownloadQueue.getEntry() on rebuild
- Active downloads immediately show expand section, Cancel button, live progress bar + status
- StoreDownloadQueue.getEntry(String) added for lookup
- store-update branch: latest commit `6702f07`, all CI green

### Pre-push — fix: restore in-progress state in all three GameDetailActivity screens (2026-04-30)
**Problem:** Opening a game's detail page while a download is running (started from the list/grid) showed
a stale Install button instead of the Cancel+progress UI. Each detail activity only checked its own
`"store_" + id` dlKey in `onResume()`, but list/grid downloads use `"store-" + id + "-list/-grid"` keys.

**Fix:**
- `StoreDownloadQueue.findActiveEntry(String... dlKeys)` added — checks multiple keys, returns first active entry
- `GogGameDetailActivity` (already committed): `activeDlKey` field + `onResume()` uses `findActiveEntry("gog_…", "gog-…-list", "gog-…-grid", "gog-…-custom")` + `onPause()` uses activeDlKey + `startInstall()` sets activeDlKey + `onBackPressed()` cancels
- `EpicGameDetailActivity`: same treatment — `findActiveEntry("epic_…", "epic-…-list", "epic-…-grid")` + `activeDlKey = dlKey` added to `startInstall()`
- `AmazonGameDetailActivity`: same treatment — `findActiveEntry("amazon_…", "amz-…-list", "amz-…-grid")` + activeDlKey + `onBackPressed()` now cancels (was missing)

Result: opening any game detail page while it is downloading (from any source) immediately shows
progress bar + current %, Cancel button, and live listener updates.

### Post-CI — fix: restore in-progress state in detail activity screens (2026-04-30)
- Commit: `33701df` | CI run: 25185762756 ✅ success
- All 3 GameDetailActivity screens (GOG/Epic/Amazon) now restore active download state on open
- findActiveEntry() bridges list/grid dlKey variants to the detail screen
- store-update branch: latest commit `33701df`, all CI green

### Post-push — fix: cancel broken for all stores (2026-04-30)
- Commit: `61df39d` | CI run: 25188067967 ✅ success
- store-update branch: latest commit `61df39d`, all CI green

### Pre-push — fix: cancel broken for all stores (2026-04-30)
**Root cause 1 — GOG cancel completely non-functional:**
`StoreDownloadQueue.startGog()` discarded the cancel `Runnable` returned by
`GogDownloadManager.startDownload()` and stored a separate `AtomicBoolean` in `cancelFlags`.
GOG's download thread has its own internal `AtomicBoolean` that was never connected to
the one in `cancelFlags` — the thread never saw the cancel signal.

**Root cause 2 — UI never resets after cancel on all stores (list/grid):**
The cancel Runnable in list/grid cards called `StoreDownloadQueue.removeListener(dlKey)`
BEFORE `onCancelled()` fired. When the thread eventually completed cancellation and
`finish()` called `l.onCancelled()`, the listener was already gone → button stayed stuck
as "Cancel".

**Fixes:**
- `StoreDownloadQueue`: replace `cancelFlags: ConcurrentHashMap<String, AtomicBoolean>` with
  `cancelActions: ConcurrentHashMap<String, Runnable>`; `cancel()` now calls the Runnable
- `finish()`: `if (!entry.active) return;` guard prevents double-call
- `startGog()`: stores the Runnable returned by `GogDownloadManager.startDownload()`; GOG cancel
  now correctly sets the internal `cancelled` flag, deletes partial files, and fires `onCancelled()`
- `startEpic()` / `startAmazon()`: cancel action = `cancelled.set(true)` + immediate `finish()`
  (for responsive UI reset); thread detects cancelled and deletes partial install dir + clears prefs
- `GogDownloadManager.doDownload()`: after `runGen2()`/`runGen1()` return non-null + cancelled →
  silent return (no `cb.onError()` call), preventing double-callback with the cancel Runnable
- `GogGamesActivity`, `EpicGamesActivity`, `AmazonGamesActivity`: removed `removeListener()` from
  all cancel Runnables — `onCancelled()` listener handles UI reset and self-removal

### v3.1 — stable release (2026-05-04)
**Branch:** `3.0` | **Tag:** `v3.1` | **Base APK:** `ludashi-3.0-lsfg-vk-base/ludashi-bionic.apk` (530.3 MB)

#### Highlights
- All store-update work from PR #4 promoted to stable: StoreDownloadQueue, GOG/Epic/Amazon GameDetailActivity ports, DownloadsActivity, main_menu_downloads, ⬇ Downloads button in each store header, list ↔ detail ↔ notification sync, cancel correctness fixes
- Base APK switched from `base-apk-3.0` (528.5 MB) to `ludashi-3.0-lsfg-vk-base` (530.3 MB) via PR #7
- Rebased `patches/res/values/public.xml` (rebuilt from new base, dropped 118 `ab_*`/`animated_background` drawables, renumbered the 6 store IDs to `0x7f090392`–`0x7f090397`) and remapped 24 literal-ID references in `MainActivity.smali` (13 shifted `R.id` values + 6 store renumberings) — fixes `AppCompatDelegateImpl.createSubDecor` NPE that surfaced under the new base

#### Path to stable
- **Pre-release** [`test-lsfg-vk-base-build`](https://github.com/The412Banner/Ludashi-plus/releases/tag/test-lsfg-vk-base-build) at commit `b09d8f7` — built via run [25295858420](https://github.com/The412Banner/Ludashi-plus/actions/runs/25295858420), device-tested by user (launch + store flows green)
- PR #7 merged into `3.0` as merge commit `2631792` (2026-05-04 01:15 UTC)
- `v3.1` tag pushed from `3.0` tip to fire workflow's stable + variants matrix (Vanilla / PuBG / Genshin / AnTuTu)

#### LSFG-VK in v3.1
The new base APK is built from [`The412Banner/Winlator-Ludashi/lsfg-vk`](https://github.com/The412Banner/Winlator-Ludashi/tree/lsfg-vk) (originally ported from ref4ik bionic). v3.1 ships the full LSFG-VK runtime:

- `assets/lsfg_vk/{Lossless.dll, android_arm64_v8a/liblsfg-vk-layer.so, android_arm64_v8a/VkLayer_LS_frame_generation.json}` — preserved through apktool decode/rebuild
- `Lcom/winlator/cmod/core/LsfgVkManager;` and `Lcom/winlator/cmod/core/LsfgQuickMenuHelper;` in classes9.dex — Ludashi-plus does not patch `smali_classes9`
- Call sites in `SettingsFragment` (settings UI), `XServerDisplayActivity` (in-game quick menu), `GuestProgramLauncherComponent` (env injection at launch) — Ludashi-plus only overrides `MainActivity.smali` in `smali_classes8`, so these survive
- Per-container keys: `lsfgEnabled`, `lsfgMultiplier`, `lsfgFlowScale`, `lsfgPerformanceMode`
- Runtime layout: `.config/lsfg-vk/conf.toml`, `.local/share/vulkan/implicit_layer.d/VkLayer_LS_frame_generation.json`, `.local/share/lsfg-vk/Lossless.dll`
