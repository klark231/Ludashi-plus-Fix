# Ludashi-plus Progress Log

Build and modification history for Ludashi-plus — Winlator Ludashi v2.9 bionic with GOG, Epic Games, and Amazon Games store integration.

---

## Session: 2026-04-08 — Game Stores Integration

### Research & Reverse Engineering (Passes 1–38)
- Full reverse engineering of Winlator Ludashi v2.9 bionic APK documented in `LUDASHI_MASTER_MAP.md`
- Mapped all 38+ passes of analysis covering: Activities, Fragments, Container system, XServerDisplayActivity launch pipeline, SharedPreferences schema, DefaultVersion constants, FEXCore/Box64 preset tables, FrameRating update intervals, env var build order
- Confirmed 3 consecutive clean passes → convergence declared

### Game Stores Feature Design
- Decision: Port BannerHub GOG/Epic/Amazon store Activities to Ludashi-plus
- Source: `~/bannerhub/extension/*.java` (29 Java files)
- Launch bridge: `LudashiLaunchBridge` uses reflection to call `ContainerManager.getContainers()` and start `XServerDisplayActivity` — no compile-time dependency on Ludashi classes

### Files Changed

#### New: `extension/` (29 Java files)
All files adapted from BannerHub: package changed `app.revanced.extension.gamehub` → `com.winlator.cmod.store`

#### Modified: `patches/res/menu/main_menu.xml`
- Added `group_game_stores` group (checkableBehavior=none) with 3 items:
  - `main_menu_gog` — "GOG"
  - `main_menu_epic` — "Epic Games"
  - `main_menu_amazon` — "Amazon Games"

#### Modified: `patches/res/values/public.xml`
- Added 4 new resource IDs:
  - `group_game_stores` = 0x7f090387
  - `main_menu_amazon` = 0x7f090388
  - `main_menu_epic` = 0x7f090389
  - `main_menu_gog` = 0x7f09038a

#### Modified: `patches/AndroidManifest.xml`
- Registered 9 new Activities:
  - `com.winlator.cmod.store.GogMainActivity`
  - `com.winlator.cmod.store.GogLoginActivity`
  - `com.winlator.cmod.store.GogGamesActivity`
  - `com.winlator.cmod.store.EpicMainActivity`
  - `com.winlator.cmod.store.EpicLoginActivity`
  - `com.winlator.cmod.store.EpicGamesActivity`
  - `com.winlator.cmod.store.AmazonMainActivity`
  - `com.winlator.cmod.store.AmazonLoginActivity`
  - `com.winlator.cmod.store.AmazonGamesActivity`

#### Modified: `patches/smali_classes8/com/winlator/cmod/MainActivity.smali`
- Added 3 `if-eq` branches before packed-switch in `onNavigationItemSelected()`:
  - `0x7f09038a` (GOG) → `startActivity(GogMainActivity)`
  - `0x7f090389` (Epic) → `startActivity(EpicMainActivity)`
  - `0x7f090388` (Amazon) → `startActivity(AmazonMainActivity)`

#### New: `.github/workflows/build.yml`
- Triggers on `v*` tags and `workflow_dispatch`
- Downloads Winlator-Ludashi v2.9 bionic APK from StevenMXZ/Winlator-Ludashi
- Decodes with apktool 2.9.3
- Applies patches/
- Compiles extension/*.java with android.jar + org.json → d8 → classes17.dex
- Injects classes17.dex into rebuilt APK
- Signs with AOSP testkey, uploads to GitHub release

### Build Process (Compilation Chain)
- `javac -source 8 -target 8 -cp android.jar:org-json.jar → ext_classes/`
- `d8 --release --min-api 26 → ext_dex/classes.dex`
- This is injected as `classes17.dex` into the APK zip after apktool build

### Launch Behavior (v1)
After game downloads in store Activity:
- `LudashiLaunchBridge.triggerLaunch(activity, exePath)` called
- Reflectively loads `ContainerManager`, gets first container
- Toast shows install path
- Starts `XServerDisplayActivity` with `container_id`
- Wine desktop opens — user navigates to exe manually

### Root Causes Fixed (CI debugging chain)
1. Wrong APK filename (`winlator-ludashi-bionic.apk` → `ludashi-bionic.apk`)
2. `ab_*.png` and `ab_gear_*.png` are raw animation frames, not valid PNGs — aapt1/aapt2 both reject them
3. `animated_background.xml` references the deleted pseudo-PNGs — must also be removed
4. `public.xml` in `patches/` retained entries for all deleted files → must remove them
5. New menu IDs (`group_game_stores`, `main_menu_gog/epic/amazon`) need explicit `<item type="id">` declaration in an ids.xml for aapt1
6. `GITHUB_TOKEN` needs `contents: write` permission for release creation in `workflow_dispatch`

### Signing
APK is signed with the AOSP public testkey (`testkey.pk8` / `testkey.x509.pem`, committed to repo). Fine for sideloading; not suitable for signature-verified updates. A private keystore stored as a GitHub Actions secret is the upgrade path if needed.

### Pending: Device Testing (2026-04-08)
- [ ] Three store entries visible in nav drawer (GOG, Epic Games, Amazon Games)
- [ ] Store Activities open correctly from nav drawer
- [ ] Login flows work (GOG OAuth, Epic redirect, Amazon PKCE)
- [ ] Library sync and game listing works
- [ ] Download pipeline works end-to-end
- [ ] Launch bridge opens Wine container after download completes (v1: user navigates to exe manually)
